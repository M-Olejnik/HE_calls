maximum amount to be granted to each third party is EUR 60 000. 
The granting authority may, up to 4 years after the end of the action, 
object to a transfer of ownership or to the exclusive licensing of results, 
as set out in the specific provision of Annex 5. 
 
Expected Outcome: Projects should contribute to all the following expected outcomes: 
• Enhanced understanding, accompanied by documented good practices, showing what 
works to encourage multilingualism in society and what type of practices have led to 
safeguarding linguistic heritage, including lesser used, endangered and historically 
marginalised languages.  
• Rigorous policy-relevant evidence, strategies and policy recommendations for promoting 
multilingualism and safeguarding linguistic diversity are available to policy makers, and 
users are involved in their development, especially the younger generation. Non -
linguistic benefits of language maintenance and revitalisation are well documented, 
communicated and understood by different stakeholders. 
• Citizens are empowered and engaged in the sustainable management of their own 
linguistic heritage and resources, with a focus on intergenerational dialogue and 
education activities, with particular attention to communities where oral transmission is 
the primary mode of language preservation. 
• Maps and visual presentations showing the linguistic diversity in Europe are available, 
including a variety of existing languages (regional and minority languages, indigenous 
languages, low resources languages etc.) and offering suited terminology and 
explanations.  
Scope: Linguistic diversity is a fundamental part of Europe’s cultural heritage. When 
languages disappear, a whole knowledge system disappears, and cultural diversity is 
impoverished. Linguistic diversity plays a key role in safeguarding cultural diversity. 
Languages are the expression of the identity, culture and the way peoples perceive their 
world. Knowledge and culture are lost when languages are lost. 
The EU has 24 official languages and some estimated 60 other languages spoken in particular 
regions or by specific groups. They are an essential part of the rich fabric of European culture. 
The proposals would document and map the situation of linguistic diversity in Europe, taking 
 
into consideration existing frameworks, initiatives and working terminology established by 
the Council of Europe and UNESCO. 
The proposals should identify examples of good practice that have resulted in richer use of 
languages in society, thus promoting multilingualism, and would support sharing of 
knowledge and good practices. 
Moreover, in recent decades, multilingual regions have been affected by a confluence of 
demographic, socio -economic, and sociocultural challenges. An aging population coupled 
with lower birthrates has strained these communities, leading to a decrease in the number of 
native speakers who can transmit their linguistic heritage to younger generations. The housing 
crisis affecting several of these regions, also driven by tourism, exacerbates this dilemma, as 
economic pressures force long-time residents to leave their ancestral homes. Migration, while 
enriching in diversity, often further dilutes the linguistic fabric as newcomers bring different 
linguistic traditions and younger generations gravitate toward globally dominant languages. 
The sociocultural landscape is equally challenging, with the loss of monolingual minority 
speakers and community life and the media environments that increasingly prioritize universal 
appeal and dominant languages over local authenticity. This is particularly acute for itinerant 
or dispersed communities, e.g. Roma communities, whose linguistic heritage is often 
overlooked in mainstream narratives. 
The proposals should explore how these elements have changed the language situation in 
those areas and how the different regions have adapted to the new linguistic environment, and 
what are the effects on the local economy. Particular attention should be given to languages 
with limited institutional support to explore how better visibility and accurate representation 
could be achieved. 
Another element changing the game for language learning and safeguarding heritage are 
digital technologies. The projects should address the online presence of different languages 
and explore how language technologies could overcome the deepening linguistic divide in the 
digital domain104, while also documenting the availability of language data. Proposals should 
also look at the presence of different languages in different forms of media, arts and wider 
forms of cultural expressions. Projects could also explore how digital platforms and AI tools 
can aid in language preservation, especially for endangered regional languages. 
The projects should explore the non-linguistic benefits of language maintenance, regeneration 
and learning. They could also look at how multilingualism and maintaining and learning 
heritage languages affects people’s wellbeing, self -respect and health due to the comfort, 
lower stress and sense of security at being able to speak their first language and not have their 
identity challenged. The actions should propose ways to encourage and support multilingual 
education and intergenerational transmission, including formal and non -formal learning 
settings. Particular consideration should be given to communities where formal education in 
the heritage language has historically been absent or discouraged. 
 
The proposals should comprise transdisciplinary collaborations (including SSH disciplines) in 
resolving this issue involving, for instance and not exhaustive, linguistics, heritage and 
museum studies, media studies, theatre studies, literary studies, socio -economic, socio -
cultural and migration studies etc. Available results of existing research on safeguarding 
linguistic diversity and multilingualism should be taken into consideration, while 
identification of needs for further research in the field should be promoted. Research could 
explore, among others, the role of oral transmission and its gendered component, in 
safeguarding languages at risk and methods to ensure its conservation. This is particularly 
relevant for languages where oral storytelling, music, and intergenerational dialogue play a 
central role in cultural transmission. 
The projects should have a dedicated place for linguistic cartography (meaningful 
representations of linguistic diversity) and explore what are the challenges of assigning 
language to space; current language mapping projects, and what are the opportunities for 
improving language mapping with current technology. 
The projects could explore how language maps could serve as educational or research tools, to 
provide illustrations of linguistic and cultural diversity. Pursuing cultural awareness and 
cultural diversity understanding makes language mapping a significant research objective. 
Proposals should develop recommendations for promoting multilingualism in our societies 
and safeguarding of linguistic diversity, empowering citizens to take ownership for 
safeguarding their linguistic heritage. These recommendations should also aim at combating 
marginalisation of disadvantaged linguistic communities, including itinerant and stateless 
groups. 
Proposals should build on existing knowledge, activities, networks and platforms, notably the 
ones funded by the EU. For example, they could include past initiatives such as the 1996 
Euromosaic study. The study documented the linguistic diversity of the 12 original EC 
countries and later of newer members which joined the EU. The Mercator European Research 
Centre on Multilingualism also carried out many regional EU -funded dossiers, which would 
benefit from updating. 
Synergies could also be created with the European Data Space for Languages and the ALT -
EDIC initiative. 105 
Furthermore, links should be established and synergies sought with closely related actions, 
such as relevant R&I actions funded by Horizon Europe or Horizon 2020. In particular, 
proposals should establish links to, and where appropriate build on findings from, projects 
funded under the topics HORIZON -CL2-2022-HERITAGE-01-01: Safeguarding endangered 
languages in Europe and ‘HORIZON -CL2-2024-HERITAGE-01-05: Strategies to strengthen 
the European linguistic capital in a globalised world. 
Proposals should engage local communities, citizens and civil society organisations, in the 
development of their actions, using participatory approaches.
