HORIZON-CL2-2026-01-TRANSFO-03: Tackling child poverty and ensuring 
disadvantaged children's access to Early Childhood Education and Care  
Call: Culture, Creativity and Inclusive Society 2026 
Specific conditions 
Expected EU 
contribution per 
project 
The Commission estimates that an EU contribution of between EUR 
3.00 and 4.00 million would allow these outcomes to be addressed 
appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and 
selection of a proposal requesting different amounts. 
Indicative budget The total indicative budget for the topic is EUR 12.00 million. 
Type of Action Research and Innovation Actions 
Legal and financial 
set-up of the Grant 
Agreements 
The rules are described in General Annex G. The following exceptions 
apply: 
Eligible costs will take the form of a lump sum as defined in the 
Decision of 7 July 2021 authorising the use of lump sum contributions 
under the Horizon Europe Programme – the Framework Programme for 
Research and Innovation (2021 -2027) – and in actions under the 
Research and Training Programme of the European Atomic Energy 
Community (2021-2025) 170. 
The granting authority may, up to 4 years after the end of the action, 
object to a transfer of ownership or to the exclusive licensing of results, 
as set out in the specific provision of Annex 5. 
 
Expected Outcome: Projects should contribute to all of the following expected outcomes: 
• Policymakers gain insights into the cost of child poverty and the returns from securing 
access of disadvantaged children to quality Early Childhood Education and Care (ECEC) 
in the EU. 
• Policymakers receive operational advice on ways to reduce this cost and support 
participation of disadvantaged children in quality ECEC to close the gap with other 
children in the EU.   
Scope: Past studies researched the cost of child poverty, and the returns yielded by and ways 
to secure disadvantaged children’s participation to ECEC, yet their relevance to the current 
EU context is limited (i.e. most of them were conducted outside of the EU or they are now 
outdated). Producing EU -specific insights on these issues is the aim of this topic, which 
 
should help close the ECEC participation gap and improve social outcomes, in line with the 
European Pillar of Social Rights, while fostering fiscal sustainability and inclusive growth. 
The proposals may: 
• Define disadvantaged children, by going beyond monetary aspects of disadvantages, 
building on the EU’s concept of risk of poverty or social exclusion, and taking into 
account systemically marginalised groups. 
• Estimate the cost of child poverty and the returns yielded by participation to quality 
ECEC by taking into account:        
 children’s needs and effective benefits targeting them,    
 the short and longer-term costs/returns,    
 the economic, social, wellbeing and educational aspects of these costs/returns,    
 children’s, parents’ and aggregate outcomes.   
• Investigate barriers preventing disadvantaged children from accessing quality ECEC. 
• Provide a mapping of the most efficient policies to reduce child poverty cost, comparing 
ECEC policies’ value for money with other policies. 
• Develop evidence-based and operational policy advice, including ways to better account 
for these costs/returns in policymaking and good (established or innovative) practices to 
close the ECEC participation gap. Scalability of these practices may be addressed. 
• Use research methodologies of relevance (qualitative and quantitative, including 
experimental ones), building on multidisciplinary insights (including from SSH 
disciplines), and either make use of existing datasets (including administrative datasets), 
or collect new data. Experts by experience (i.e. vulnerable children and parents) may be 
involved.
