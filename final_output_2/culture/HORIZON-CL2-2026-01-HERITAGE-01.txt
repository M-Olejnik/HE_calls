as set out in the specific provision of Annex 5. 
 
Expected Outcome: Proposals should contribute to the first two expected outcomes, and either 
the one listed under Focus 1, or the one listed under Focus 2. 
• The potential of art -science and/or technology collaborations to address societal 
challenges and drive innovation is better understood. Guidance, toolkits, and actionable 
methodologies are developed to promote these collaborations, providing policymakers, 
professionals, and training organisations with clarity on intervention scope, applicability 
across various fields, and evaluation methods, metrics, or tools. 
• New and existing national, European or international networks for art -science-
technology collaborations are established or strengthened, expanding opportunities for 
artists to engage with science and technology.   
Focus 1 
Approaches, methodologies and model interventions for integrating arts and creative practices 
to enhance soft skills across public and private sectors are developed, tested and disseminated. 
Focus 2 
The effectiveness of critical artists’ engagement in interdisciplinary teams is demonstrated 
alongside the assessment of the viability of research -intensive emerging technologies through 
at least three low technology readiness level (TRL) pilot demonstrators. 
Scope: Artistic research fosters inter -, multi -, and trans -disciplinary thinking, inspiring 
innovative problem-solving and offering new avenues for innovation across policy areas, akin 
 
to scientific research. EU initiatives such as SciArt and S+T+ARTS 83 show that art -science-
technology collaborations enhance scientific and technological progress. Art acts as a catalyst 
for innovation, developing creative solutions to complex challenges and brings fresh 
perspectives to the scientific community. Artistic research is increasingly fostering mutual 
fertilization between the arts and academia. Collaboration with artists leads academics to 
adopt experimental practices, while artists increasingly engage with theoretical aspects of 
their practice. Closer collaboration between artists and companies in emerging technologies 
ensures that technological developments are guided by diverse, human -centred perspectives. 
Artistic research offers cross -disciplinary insights that challenge conventional thinking, spark 
innovation beyond technical efficiency, and address societal challenges holistically. 
Furthermore, artistic intelligence84 makes complex concepts accessible and engages audiences 
emotionally and culturally. Artistic expression facilitates the adoption of innovative concepts 
and practices and catalyses social innovation, supporting sustainable and inclusive societal 
transformations and the cultural uptake of socio -scientific issues. Now is the time to 
consolidate understanding of the transformative potential of art -science-technology 
collaborations, distil it for application across policy areas and levels, and develop methods to 
evaluate their impact both quantitatively and qualitatively. Projects are expected to: 
• Gather evidence on art -science-technology collaborations for addressing societal 
challenges and spurring innovation in science and technology. 
• Collect case studies, produce and disseminate guidance, toolkits, and methodologies 
supporting policymakers in promoting these collaborations and strategies for cross -
disciplinary innovation. Mechanisms, span of possible interventions, applicability to 
diverse fields and contexts will be clarified and exemplified. 
• Develop concrete use cases, such as (but not limited to): artists supporting ethical, 
inclusive, human -centred AI; addressing societal challenges and complex 
transformations through art -science-technology collaboration, advancing emotional 
storytelling, experiential art and public engagement through AI and real -time data; 
public sector roles in the art -science-technology uptake; role of artists in catalysing 
innovation in policymaking; participatory art -science-technology initiatives and citizen 
science. 
• Develop and test qualitative and quantitative methodologies and key performance 
indicators for evaluating such interventions, assessing their impacts, measuring their 
medium to long-term benefits and identifying what constitutes success. 
 
• Increase opportunities for artists to engage in art -science-technology collaborations, 
through network establishment or consolidation, interdisciplinary initiatives or other 
methods.   
Project consortia should include artists and creatives/representatives of creative industries. 
Through leveraging creativity, projects should boost EU productivity and competitiveness 
while improving artists and creative professionals' employment conditions and preserving the 
autonomy and freedom essential to artistic practice and democratic society. 
Financial support to third parties of up to EUR 60.000 in the form of grants may be 
considered, with the aim of actively engaging artists and creative professionals, for example 
through residencies, to facilitate development of solutions and innovative experimentations. 
In addition to the main focus area, proposals should choose between the following two 
focuses: 
Focus 1. Enhancing soft skills through creativity and the arts 
Policies and strategies for introducing creative thinking and cross - and transdisciplinary 
methods in education, research and the broader public and private sectors are needed. In the 
workforce, engaging with creative practices and the arts enhances soft skills -such as 
creativity, critical thinking, problem -solving, emotional intelligence - crucial for productivity 
and competitiveness in an increasingly automated world 85 and to meet the demands of a 
changing market. Supporting research and innovation in this area will help individuals and 
institutions develop the skills and mindsets needed to thrive and increase creativity, 
productivity and well -being, including mental health, in a complex, interconnected society. 
Projects are expected to develop, experiment, and disseminate frameworks for using the arts 
and creative practices to strengthen soft skills in various public and private sectors, including 
education and lifelong learning, public administration and corporate environments, and 
showcase best practices. Proposals may choose their own areas of application. 
Focus 2. Pilots on emerging technologies 
Proposals should develop at least 3 small scale pilots on emerging technologies in 
interdisciplinary settings involving artists, to assess, demonstrate and streamline research -
intensive technologies. Candidate technologies could include, among others, immersive arts, 
grid sensing networks, multisensuality, ubiquitous XR, spatial computing, VLM/LLM and 
historical data, crowd digitization or virtual reality. Pilots should demonstrate the 
effectiveness of artists’ engagement. 
Proposals should clearly indicate the focus they have selected. 
Proposals should consider the involvement of the European Commission's Joint Research 
Centre (JRC) based on its experience, in particular with the SciArt programme, and with 
 
respect to the value it could bring in providing an effective interface between research 
activities and policymaking.
