HORIZON-CL2-2027-01-TRANSFO-06: Closing the learning gap: uncovering causes 
and effective policy interventions for declining youth skills in mathematics, reading, and 
science 
Call: Culture, Creativity and Inclusive Society - 2027 
Specific conditions 
Expected EU 
contribution per 
project 
The Commission estimates that an EU contribution of between EUR 
3.00 and 4.00 million would allow these outcomes to be addressed 
appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and 
selection of a proposal requesting different amounts. 
Indicative budget The total indicative budget for the topic is EUR 12.00 million. 
Type of Action Research and Innovation Actions 
Legal and financial 
set-up of the Grant 
Agreements 
The rules are described in General Annex G. The following exceptions 
apply: 
The granting authority may, up to 4 years after the end of the action, 
object to a transfer of ownership or to the exclusive licensing of results, 
as set out in the specific provision of Annex 5. 
Eligible costs will take the form of a lump sum as defined in the 
Decision of 7 July 2021 authorising the use of lump sum contributions 
under the Horizon Europe Programme – the Framework Programme for 
Research and Innovation (2021 -2027) – and in actions under the 
Research and Training Programme of the European Atomic Energy 
Community (2021-2025) 204. 
 
Expected Outcome: Projects should contribute to all of the following expected outcomes: 
• Provide policymakers with a solid understanding of the structural causes for the decline 
in young people’s skills levels in mathematics, reading and science, including low and 
top levels of achievement, observed in the EU over the past 15 years. 
• Generate rigorous, policy-relevant evidence about which teaching practices, programmes 
and policy actions can be effective to reverse that decline, including the role of curricula, 
structural aspects of education and training systems, physical and digital learning 
environments, and innovative teaching and learning methods (including their 
accessibility). 
• Develop actionable advice to inform policy measures, programmes, future evaluations 
and actions for education and training systems in the field of basic skills.  
Scope: Young people's mathematics, reading and science skills, as measured by large -scale 
international assessments such as the OECD Programme for International Student Assessment 
(PISA), have significantly declined in Europe over the past 15 years. This applies both to the 
low and top levels of achievement. Reversing that trend is one of the fundamental objectives 
of the Union of Skills. 
While the research literature has well analysed the short -term impact of the COVID-19 crisis, 
the structural causes of the observed decline are still poorly understood. More in -depth 
 
research is necessary, using various data sources at national and international level. Several 
interrelated research questions remain to be addressed, such as: 
• How have changes in teaching methods, curriculum design, and assessment practices 
influenced the decline in mathematics, reading and science skills over time?  
• What role do digital distractions and shifts in reading habits from paper to digital devices 
play? 
• What is the role handwriting and drawing for cognitive development? 
• What is the link between acquisition of cognitive skills in maths, science and reading on 
the one hand and the socio -emotional skills, learning skills, self -regulation, school 
climate on the other. 
• To what extent does the increasing (also migration -related) heterogeneity of the students 
make it more difficult to organise learning at school? 
• How does parental involvement affect educational performance? 
• Do different levels of parental involvement affect educational performance? 
• What is the role of cultural institutions such as museums and libraries? 
• What is the combined impact of socio -economic background and gender on gaps in 
educational performance? 
• How do different levels of investment in public education, and teacher shortages and 
working conditions affect the educational performance of children?   
Proposals should also take into account the perspective of young people and other relevant 
stakeholders as part of the data collection. Close cooperation with authorities and/or other 
institutions owning the data is essential and should be ensured. 
Understanding the causes of this decline is the pre -condition for analysing the causal impact 
of various remedial measures and identifying effective policies and programmes to improve 
young people’s skills in mathematics, reading and science. Proposals should apply 
experimental and/or quasi -experimental methods for their analysis and could complement 
them with qualitative research methods. Proposals should also evaluate the costs associated 
with the policy measures or programmes analysed. Interdisciplinary approaches, combining 
insights from economics, sociology, psychology, neurosciences and education sciences, and 
more generally, the social sciences and humanities (SSH), are encouraged. Clustering and 
cooperation among selected projects under this call topic and other relevant projects are 
strongly encouraged.
