HORIZON-CL2-2026-01-TRANSFO-07: Fostering competences for the green transition 
Call: Culture, Creativity and Inclusive Society 2026 
Specific conditions 
Expected EU 
contribution per 
The Commission estimates that an EU contribution of between EUR 
3.00 and 4.00 million would allow these outcomes to be addressed 
project appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and 
selection of a proposal requesting different amounts. 
Indicative budget The total indicative budget for the topic is EUR 12.00 million. 
Type of Action Research and Innovation Actions 
Legal and financial 
set-up of the Grant 
Agreements 
The rules are described in General Annex G. The following exceptions 
apply: 
Eligible costs will take the form of a lump sum as defined in the 
Decision of 7 July 2021 authorising the use of lump sum contributions 
under the Horizon Europe Programme – the Framework Programme for 
Research and Innovation (2021 -2027) – and in actions under the 
Research and Training Programme of the European Atomic Energy 
Community (2021-2025) 176. 
The granting authority may, up to 4 years after the end of the action, 
object to a transfer of ownership or to the exclusive licensing of results, 
as set out in the specific provision of Annex 5. 
 
Expected Outcome: Projects should contribute to all of the following expected outcomes: 
• Provide policymakers, education and training institutions, and social partners with a 
solid understanding of which competences young people and workers need to support 
the EU economy towards the green transition to reach carbon neutrality and protect 
natural ecosystems. 
• Develop actionable advice to policymakers and education and training institutions about 
which education and training programmes and policy measures can promote the 
acquisition of those competences by young people and workers in a lifelong perspective, 
including the gender and disability dimensions. 
• Provide policymakers with guidance on how to address the interconnection between 
fostering the competences for the green transition and those for the digital transition.   
Scope: Environmental challenges have been one of the key drivers of labour demand and 
skills supply across all sectors for the past years. More data and analysis from research on 
competences that young people and workers need for the green transition are warranted to 
properly implement the Union of Skills and support people in upskilling and reskilling. The 
availability of robust quantitative data is still limited, both at national and international levels. 
Moreover, most available research on the green transition focuses on macro -level policies, 
overlooking how workers and communities can drive change. 
 
Fostering competences for the green transition also requires a better understanding of young 
people’s and workers’ attitudes, concerns and behaviours about climate change and climate 
action, biodiversity loss, pollution, circular economy and sustainable economic growth, as 
well as of new ways of developing capabilities and skills 177. The transferability of skills 
across occupations and the need for upskilling and reskilling the current workforce are also 
key to advancing the green transition. These issues are interconnected with the ongoing digital 
transition. 
The ‘green transition’ embraces a wide and diverse set of sectors and activities without one 
specific set of generic competences (in other words skills vary strongly depending on the 
sector). For example, according to Cedefop178, among high climate impact sectors the demand 
for skills for the green transition is the highest in energy. Therefore, proposals should focus on 
one of the following sectors, which are particularly affected by an increasing demand for 
green expertise: 1) sustainable agriculture and food production, 2) automotive industry, 3) 
energy and 4) construction, 5) nature and climate adaptation.  
Proposals should use quantitative and qualitative methods (including from SSH disciplines) 
and apply a lifelong perspective to address several research questions, such as: 
• What are the most relevant competences required to actively contribute to the green 
transition in these industries? 
• Which assessment methods and frameworks are most effective in measuring readiness 
for green jobs and sustainable innovation? 
• What roles do digital skills and technological literacy play in equipping young people 
and workers for the green transition and how can education and training systems exploit 
the synergies between the competences for the green and digital transitions? 
• How can policymakers, education and training institutions and employers collaborate to 
identify and address skills shortages that may hinder the green transition? 
• How can vocational education and training systems become more accessible and flexible 
to respond effectively to evolving labour market needs for the green transition? 
• How to ensure that women and persons with disabilities benefit equally from the 
opportunities of the green transition? 
• How does an effective lifelong acquisition of competences for the green transition 
occur? 
•  How can we design and implement inclusive systems that improve career advice, and 
support the best decisions by all learners regarding t their career choices and pathways? 
 
• What works to get disadvantaged children onto the pathways that are proven to lead to 
upwards mobility (including helping those who are not in education, employment or 
training) and raising ambition where needed? At what age are interventions most 
effective? 
• How can policymakers best create collaborations with industry to increase training 
opportunities, to ensure learners are as prepared as much as possible for work, and to 
reduce barriers to those from disadvantaged backgrounds?   
Proposals should also consider the gender and disability dimensions in their analysis 
(ensuring that women, as well as persons with disability, benefit equally from employment 
and earning opportunities linked to the green transition). Clustering and cooperation among 
selected projects under this call topic and other relevant projects, for example from the 
Horizon 2020 European Green Deal Call and their results, are strongly encouraged. 
Proposals should also explore synergies with the New European Bauhaus (NEB) Facility, 
including notably the NEB Academy on skills for sustainable construction, and the European 
Partnership on Social Transformations and Resilience.
