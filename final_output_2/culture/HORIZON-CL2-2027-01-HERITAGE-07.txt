Call: Culture, Creativity and Inclusive Society - 2027 
Specific conditions 
Expected EU 
contribution per 
project 
The Commission estimates that an EU contribution of between EUR 
2.50 and 3.00 million would allow these outcomes to be addressed 
appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and 
selection of a proposal requesting different amounts. 
Indicative budget The total indicative budget for the topic is EUR 15.00 million. 
Type of Action Research and Innovation Actions 
Procedure The procedure is described in General Annex F. The following 
exceptions apply: 
To ensure a balanced portfolio, grants will be awarded to applications 
not only in order of ranking but at least also to those that are the highest 
ranked within each area provided in the scope (A, B and C), provided 
that the applications attain all thresholds.  
Legal and financial 
set-up of the Grant 
Agreements 
The rules are described in General Annex G. The following exceptions 
apply: 
The granting authority may, up to 4 years after the end of the action, 
object to a transfer of ownership or to the exclusive licensing of results, 
as set out in the specific provision of Annex 5. 
Eligible costs will take the form of a lump sum as defined in the 
Decision of 7 July 2021 authorising the use of lump sum contributions 
under the Horizon Europe Programme – the Framework Programme for 
Research and Innovation (2021 -2027) – and in actions under the 
Research and Training Programme of the European Atomic Energy 
Community (2021-2025) 150. 
 
Expected Outcome: Projects should contribute to all of the following expected outcomes: 
 
• Enhanced understanding of the societal impact of cultural heritage; Good practices and 
case studies to enable positive societal impact described and documented, for the context 
of the research area chosen.  
• Capacity building and knowledge dissemination among practitioners and policymakers.  
• Produce and disseminate policy recommendations, guidance, and toolkits, supporting 
policymakers, in. the context of the research area chosen as appropriate.   
Scope: Heritage is a dynamic resource that can foster societal resilience, intercultural 
dialogue, and a sense of belonging in increasingly diverse and fragmented societies. It can 
contribute to social cohesion and resilience through arts, design and cultural practices. Thus, 
cultural heritage is central to the preservation of the social fabric and community cohesion. 
Understanding and amplifying the societal impact of cultural heritage is essential for 
reinforcing identity, cohesion, and global leadership based on shared values. Research 
proposals should explore how cultural heritage actively shapes civic engagement, social 
innovation, collective memory, and the transmission of democratic values. 
Moreover, it is crucial to develop new narratives around heritage — ones that are forward -
looking, critically aware, and deeply connected to Europe's evolving values. Such work will 
not only strengthen Europe's internal cohesion but also position cultural heritage as a strategic 
asset in addressing global challenges. 
In this context, social innovation could also translate into working with cultural heritage 
practitioners and custodians to explore how cultural heritage can solve some of today's 
societal challenges (achieving better social inclusion, social cohesion, well -being, and 
equality). Whereas previous research (including contributions by SSH disciplines) has widely 
explored developing heritage -based education, contribution of culture to rural development 
and cultural tourism, there are some fields that could benefit from more research: cultural 
participation and access to culture, with a focus on young people; gender roles and identities; 
a shared cultural heritage and shared responsibility in the light of security challenges. 
Research projects should choose one of the following areas: 
A. Cultural participation and access to cultural heritage 
Access to culture, acquired through socialisation and education, plays a crucial role in shaping 
cultural practices and preferences. As mentioned in the Political Guidelines 151  for the 
European Commission, there is a need to improve access to cultural heritage, in particular for 
young people, and contribute to tackle cultural inequality and strengthen a sense of identity 
and belonging. In addition, attention should be paid to disadvantaged groups, eventually 
solidifying participatory culture and democracy and fostering a sense of stewardship towards 
cultural heritage. 
 
A Special Eurobarometer on Europeans’ Attitudes Towards Culture 152, published in May 
2025, showed that a majority of Europeans believe that their country and the EU should work 
more closely together when it comes to making arts and culture more accessible to everyone. 
Prior research 153 indicates that increased cultural participation can potentially enhance civic 
engagement, social inclusion, and democratic governance, and counteract alienation and 
social disengagement. However, research also indicates profound and multifaceted barriers to 
access. These barriers include, for example, geography, including the challenge of rural 
isolation; under-representation of minority groups; economic disparity. 
The proposals should explore good practices for fostering access to cultural heritage, with a 
focus on young people and ways to empower them to take an active role in their communities 
and strengthen social cohesion. Proposals should also explore which are the main barriers for 
access to culture and effective means to increase cultural participation, identifying 
specificities for different types of groups. 
The proposals should employ interdisciplinary and participatory methods to identify effective 
models for inclusive cultural participation. Results are expected to guide policies on cultural 
access, with recommendations, for instance, for digital infrastructure, educational 
programmes, and cross-sector collaboration to foster inclusive citizenship. 
B. Gender roles and identities 
Cultural heritage has the power to promote diversity and inclusion by showcasing diverse 
narratives and histories, but it can also perpetuate inequality if stereotypes, cultural role 
models, and representations are limited or biased, silencing marginalised voices. 
The proposed research should explore the complex relationships between cultural 
productions, representations and societal attitudes towards different sexes and gender 
identities, with a focus on understanding how culture can shape our cultural landscape and 
influence our attitudes and imaginaries. 
Proposals should provide an analysis of the representation and overview of different gender 
identities and intersecting factors such as racial or ethnical background, disability or 
socioeconomic background, in cultural fields. Proposals should explore how gender aspects 
have been absent, or forgotten, in major supranational cultural narratives. Proposals should 
provide actionable recommendations on how to promote a more inclusive and diverse 
representation, including in the cultural content, and to address the absence of diverse 
representations in the cultural field. These recommendations should be developed in a 
dialogue with different stakeholders, for example researchers, policymakers, cultural heritage 
institutions, civil society representatives. 
C. Cultural heritage, cohesion and security 
 
The proposed research should explore the role and conceptualisation of cultural heritage as a 
distinctive element of our shared identities and democratic values. It should also examine the 
links between culture and security including issues of disinformation and foreign information 
manipulation and interference (FIMI) etc. Proposals are expected to explore the notions of 
shared heritage and shared responsibility as an expression of our social interdependence, and 
culture as a factor of union and cohesion. 
Cases of instrumentalisation of cultural heritage and the political influence on museums or 
other cultural institutions should also be taken into account in the research. Culture can also 
face factors of destabilisation, attacks on cultural heritage can destabilise society and 
jeopardize security while cultural content can greatly influence public opinion and the 
imaginaries. The proposals should explore how to deal with polarising narratives and 
controversial aspects of cultural heritage use. 
The proposals should propose good practices, policy guidelines, run pilot projects and 
propose didactic materials to raise awareness on existing challenges, enhance “neutrality” in 
cultural heritage management, collective responsibility and cultural resilience; explore the 
notions of care and repair applied to cultural heritage. 
Proposals shall clearly indicate the thematic area they have selected to work on. 
Proposals should adopt a multidisciplinary approach (involving, for instance and not 
exhaustively, heritage and museum studies, cultural anthropology, ethnology, media studies, 
theatre studies, literary studies, musicology etc.) to assess and demonstrate how cultural 
heritage initiatives contribute to societal well-being, community empowerment, inclusion, and 
sustainable development while identification of needs for further research in the field should 
be promoted. 
Proposals should prioritize empirical research, participatory methodologies, and policy 
innovation to maximize and communicate the transformative power of cultural heritage across 
all layers of society. 
Proposals should connect to both formal and non -formal education, particularly arts 
education. Encouraging collaboration between cultural heritage actors and educational 
institutions would enhance impact. 
Proposals should build on existing knowledge, activities, networks and platforms, notably the 
ones funded by the EU, for example paying attention to the future digital tools and platforms 
provided by the European Collaborative Cloud for Cultural Heritage (ECCCH), and the 
Common European Data Space for Cultural Heritage. 
Furthermore, links should be established and complementarities sought with closely related 
actions, such as relevant R&I actions funded by Horizon Europe or Horizon 2020.
