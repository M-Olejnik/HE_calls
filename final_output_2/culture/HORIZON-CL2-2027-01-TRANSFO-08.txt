HORIZON-CL2-2027-01-TRANSFO-08: Scaling and deploying innovations in 
migration management 
Call: Culture, Creativity and Inclusive Society - 2027 
Specific conditions 
Expected EU 
contribution per 
project 
The Commission estimates that an EU contribution of between EUR 
3.00 and 3.75 million would allow these outcomes to be addressed 
appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and 
selection of a proposal requesting different amounts. 
Indicative budget The total indicative budget for the topic is EUR 15.00 million. 
Type of Action Innovation Actions 
Eligibility 
conditions 
The conditions are described in General Annex B. The following 
exceptions apply: 
The Joint Research Centre (JRC) may participate as member of the 
consortium selected for funding as a beneficiary with zero funding, or 
as an associated partner. The JRC will not participate in the preparation 
and submission of the proposal - see General Annex B. 
Legal and financial 
set-up of the Grant 
Agreements 
The rules are described in General Annex G. The following exceptions 
apply: 
The granting authority may, up to 4 years after the end of the action, 
object to a transfer of ownership or to the exclusive licensing of results, 
as set out in the specific provision of Annex 5. 
Eligible costs will take the form of a lump sum as defined in the 
Decision of 7 July 2021 authorising the use of lump sum contributions 
under the Horizon Europe Programme – the Framework Programme for 
Research and Innovation (2021 -2027) – and in actions under the 
Research and Training Programme of the European Atomic Energy 
Community (2021-2025) 208. 
 
Expected Outcome: Projects should contribute to all of the following expected outcomes: 
• Enhanced impact of EU -funded migration research by identifying and scaling up 
promising innovations, methodologies, and tools from relevant Horizon 2020 and 
Horizon Europe projects. 
• A policy innovation ecosystem: Foster collaboration between researchers, policymakers, 
and practitioners to adapt, scale, and deploy validated models, ensuring their scalability, 
sustainability, and practical application in diverse EU, national and local contexts.   
Scope: Despite significant EU investment in migration research, many innovative solutions to 
gain insights and foresight remain underutilized in policymaking and practice. This topic aims 
to bridge that gap by systematically identifying, assessing, and facilitating the adoption of 
promising approaches developed in past EU -funded migration related projects to ensure a 
better fungibility between knowledge-oriented activities on past or future trends of migrations 
and policy making. 
Proposals should map and analyse research outputs, methodologies, and innovations from 
relevant Horizon 2020 and Horizon Europe migration projects, selecting those with high 
 
potential for policy uptake, operational implementation, market deployment and scaling. 
Proposals should consider ways to validate, adapt, and scale up these solutions across 
different governance levels (EU, national, local) and migration -related domains implementing 
high ethical standards and ensuring fundamental rights and privacy of all individuals affected. 
Applicants are encouraged to engage key stakeholders - including policymakers, migration 
practitioners, researchers (including from SSH disciplines), the private sector; groups or 
individuals that represent the interests of refugees and migrants and the civil society - to 
ensure that identified innovations align with real -world needs and implementation pathways 
and taking into account the political, legal, and cultural specificities of each Member State 
that influence implementation, while ensuring the solutions are transferable across contexts. 
Proposals are encouraged to take into consideration the assessment of the societal and 
political impacts as well as recommendations of previously funded Horizon research projects 
on migration. To that end, proposals are encouraged to carry out a mapping exercise. 
Activities may include pilots, policy labs, co -creation processes, or other mechanisms to 
enhance the transferability of research outcomes into policies and operational frameworks. 
A core element of the action will be fostering a structured dialogue between the research 
community and decision -makers to ensure continuous knowledge transfer and innovation 
mainstreaming. The initiative should contribute to a more dynamic, responsive and 
anticipatory EU migration ecosystem in the intersection of policy and research, in line with 
the objectives of the EU Pact on Asylum and Migration and other relevant policy frameworks. 
Proposals may incorporate a gender -sensitive and intersectional approach in their research if 
relevant, by collecting data based for example on age, ability, ethnic and racial background, 
sex, socioeconomic status, and religion or belief to ensure that identified migration -related 
innovations align with real-world needs of people in migratory situation. 
Proposals should delineate the plans for further applications of the knowledge, solutions and 
findings generated by their research at national and EU level. Knowledge and findings may be 
used with EU co -financing of instruments such as the Asylum, Migration and Integration 
Fund (AMIF) and/or subsequent funding instruments. 
Proposals may envisage JRC participation, particularly to support the assessment of 
relevance, scalability and uptake of innovative solutions in migration management. The JRC 
could contribute with its knowledge of EU's migration systems, foresight, and capacity to 
bridge research and policymaking.
