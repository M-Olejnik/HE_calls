Specific conditions 
Expected EU 
contribution per 
project 
The Commission estimates that an EU contribution of between EUR 
3.50 and 4.00 million would allow these outcomes to be addressed 
appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and 
selection of a proposal requesting different amounts. 
Indicative budget The total indicative budget for the topic is EUR 12.00 million. 
Type of Action Innovation Actions 
Eligibility The conditions are described in General Annex B. The following 
 
conditions exceptions apply: 
Subject to restrictions for the protection of European communication 
networks. 
In order to achieve the expected outcomes, consortia must include, as 
beneficiaries or affiliated entities, at least one news media 
organisation27. 
Legal and 
financial set-up of 
the Grant 
Agreements 
The rules are described in General Annex G. The following exceptions 
apply: 
Eligible costs will take the form of a lump sum as defined in the 
Decision of 7 July 2021 authorising the use of lump sum contributions 
under the Horizon Europe Programme – the Framework Programme for 
Research and Innovation (2021 -2027) – and in actions under the 
Research and Training Programme of the European Atomic Energy 
Community (2021-2025) 28. 
The granting authority may, up to 4 years after the end of the action, 
object to a transfer of ownership or to the exclusive licensing of results, 
as set out in the specific provision of Annex 5. 
 
Expected Outcome: Projects should contribute to all of the following expected outcomes: 
• Reinforced digital transformation of the news media industry by facilitating the 
development of new business models, contributing to a more resilient and inclusive 
democracies. 
• Citizens, particularly those facing systemic disadvantages, are empowered and better 
equipped to make informed decisions, and news media’s role as contributor to a healthy, 
reinvigorated and fair democracy is enhanced.  
•  Stronger engagement with emerging media creators (such as influencers and other 
online content producers) to promote transparency and accountability in their role in 
sharing information, and to foster reliance on trustworthy media sources.  
Scope: Democracies are at risk when reliable and independent journalism is at risk. Yet, in 
order to be truly independent, media need sustainable financing models. At present, 
journalistic newsrooms are under severe economic pressure. Social media forces them to 
compete for citizens’ attention with other forms of infotainment, which sometimes entail 
unverified opinions and low -quality or malicious sources. To promote a well -informed 
 
democratic debate, citizens must be able to distinguish quality journalism abiding by 
professional standards, from opinion pieces and other forms of content, as free speech can 
thrive in ecosystems that enhance access to verified information and empower citizens to 
recognise it. Such ecosystems need to help distinguish sources that apply journalistic 
principles, including methods to ensure accuracy, independence, objectivity, impartiality, 
inclusivity and plural viewpoints.  
To compete in the digital age, European media need to embrace innovation. The 
Commission’s 2023 European Media industry outlook 29 signalled that “an early adoption and 
usage of new technologies is key to adapt and open new markets”. Thus, applicants are 
invited to work together with news media organisations from the start to enhance innovation 
across the news media sectors, including by designing industrial and user -driven applications, 
on areas and aspects such as: 
a) development and take up of methods to recognise content produced with journalistic 
standards (e.g. through trust indicators, browser plugins, etc.), to categorise such content (e.g. 
through industry-led crawlers, common taxonomies, metadata standards, etc.) and to promote 
such content (e.g. through inclusive and transparent news -oriented algorithms, recommender 
systems that show multiple views and prioritise quality information); 
b) identification of AI models that can help media build attractive services (e.g. chat bots, 
search tools, aggregators) and other relevant models which can generate revenues (e.g. 
dynamic paywalls, advertising, copyright revenues, etc.); 
c) innovative methods to ensure user -centric design and user engagement strategies, in 
compliance with journalistic standards; 
d) roll -out of these models and methods towards the development of truly pan -European 
innovative platforms and/or interoperable standards within the project lifetime; 
e) initiatives to federate media industries along a joint innovation agenda. 
Innovation projects should focus on concrete ways to help journalistic content serve 
democracy by addressing aspects such as: 
• ensuring that journalistic content remains economically viable in AI -intermediated 
information spaces; 
• ensuring that journalistic content retains relevance and prominence in AI -driven search 
tools and future information ecosystems in Europe; 
• ensuring that algorithms based on journalistic standards (such as accuracy and inclusion) 
are developed enhancing professional journalism and preserving a trustworthy 
information ecosystem; 
 
• making sure that citizens are presented with multiple views online to make well -
informed decisions; 
• development and integration of journalistic trust indicators in recommender systems, 
browsers and/or European news aggregators; 
• take-up of recommender systems that prioritise trusted sources and professional 
journalism; 
• development of better digital advertising business models for news producers, through 
proprietary systems that offer more brand safety and sufficiently detailed feedback to 
advertisers through joint metadata and audience measurement tools; 
• development of EU -level business case studies, explaining their impact on creation of 
advertising revenues, subscription revenues, etc.; 
• development and adoption of prototypes for recommender systems, proprietary crawlers, 
proprietary metadata generators, paywalls, advertising systems or other revenue -
generating systems that can strengthen the economic viability of journalism.   
Proposals are encouraged to investigate the behavioural dimensions of news consumption, 
focusing on how reader habits, trust, and perceptions influence engagement with journalism. 
This may include examining the role of behavioural science in designing interventions (such 
as nudges, gamification, or educational tools) to counter misinformation and strengthen 
critical thinking among audiences. Proposals are also encouraged to explore the evolving trust 
dynamics between human -curated journalism and AI -driven news delivery, addressing how 
public perceptions of reliability, bias, and transparency differ across these sources.  
Where relevant, proposals are encouraged to investigate the need for transparency and 
accountability mechanisms for influencers and content creators who rely on media content in 
their work. This may entail advocating for clear disclosure of sources, partnerships, and 
potential biases, as well as fostering collaboration between content creators and media actors, 
to amplify the visibility and credibility of reliable information sources, ensuring audiences are 
informed by fact-based, ethically produced content. 
Projects are encouraged to involve the relevant parts of the news media ecosystems to ensure 
take-up of the proposed models. All news media segments are eligible under this action 
(public, private media, sectoral media, etc) and collaboration across segments and across 
borders is encouraged. The participation in the consortia of research and academic actors from 
relevant disciplines, such as information science and media studies, as well as tech companies 
(e.g. ad-tech or other) to build workable prototypes, and SSH, is strongly encouraged. Where 
applicable, applicants should leverage the data and services available through European 
Research Infrastructures federated under the European Open Science Cloud (EOSC), as well 
as data from relevant Data Spaces. 
Clustering and cooperation among the selected projects under this topic are strongly 
encouraged.
