HORIZON-CL2-2027-01-DEMOCRACY-02: Women’s, LGBTIQ and minority rights 
in a context of autocracy, conflict and geopolitical shifts 
Call: Culture, Creativity and Inclusive Society - 2027 
Specific conditions 
Expected EU 
contribution per 
project 
The Commission estimates that an EU contribution of between EUR 
3.50 and 4.00 million would allow these outcomes to be addressed 
appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and 
selection of a proposal requesting different amounts. 
Indicative budget The total indicative budget for the topic is EUR 12.00 million. 
Type of Action Research and Innovation Actions 
Legal and financial 
set-up of the Grant 
Agreements 
The rules are described in General Annex G. The following exceptions 
apply: 
The granting authority may, up to 4 years after the end of the action, 
object to a transfer of ownership or to the exclusive licensing of results, 
as set out in the specific provision of Annex 5. 
Eligible costs will take the form of a lump sum as defined in the 
Decision of 7 July 2021 authorising the use of lump sum contributions 
under the Horizon Europe Programme – the Framework Programme for 
Research and Innovation (2021 -2027) – and in actions under the 
Research and Training Programme of the European Atomic Energy 
Community (2021-2025) 53. 
 
 
Expected Outcome: Projects should contribute to all of the following expected outcomes: 
• Policymakers, public administrations, human rights organisations, and civil society 
actors have strengthened mechanisms to protect groups in a vulnerable situation (such as 
women, LGBTIQ people, persons with disabilities and minorities) in contexts of 
autocracy, conflict, and geopolitical instability. 
• Researchers and data collection bodies benefit from robust methodologies to 
systematically document and analyse the impact of democratic backsliding, conflict, and 
geopolitical shifts on the rights of these specific groups in a vulnerable situation. 
• Civil society organisations and grassroots movements have enhanced their resilience and 
advocacy strategies, thanks to the identification of best practices and innovative 
approaches to counter repression, expand civic space, and promote inclusive governance, 
including in authoritarian or conflict settings.   
Scope: Autocratic regimes, armed conflicts, and global geopolitical shifts pose significant 
threats to fundamental rights. These challenges manifest in the rollback of legal protections, 
increased political violence, shrinking civic space, and targeted discrimination, both offline 
and online. In this context, a deeper understanding of the disproportionate impact of these 
crises on different groups is key to developing more targeted and effective policies. 
The proposed research should examine the intersection of age, gender, sex, sexual orientation, 
minority status, or migratory background, in contexts of democratic erosion, authoritarian 
governance, and geopolitical crises. It can focus on one or multiple groups in a vulnerable 
situation, such as women, LGBTIQ people, ethnic and/or religious minorities, people with 
disabilities, children or the elderly. Case studies could be selected to reflect a wide range of 
geopolitical contexts, including regions undergoing democratic erosion, post -conflict 
reconstruction, or consolidation of authoritarian rule.  
The proposed research should analyse how legal and institutional frameworks are weaponised 
and leveraged by authoritarian actors to restrict rights, the role of civil society in resisting 
repression, and the impact of digital surveillance, algorithmic discrimination and online 
disinformation in targeting specific groups in a vulnerable situation.  
Particular attention should be given to the restricted access to sexual and reproductive health 
rights during crises, armed conflicts, and geopolitical shifts, as well as the prevalence of 
gender-based violence (GBV). In such contexts, GBV can be frequently used as a coercive 
tactic, reinforcing discrimination and reversing progress on gender equality. Hate -motivated 
violence can become even more complex when directed at women and groups in a vulnerable 
situation, further limiting their access to humanitarian assistance and undermining their 
fundamental rights. Therefore, the proposed research should develop prevention and response 
strategies for public administration, law enforcement, and military bodies to combat GBV 
effectively in crisis situations. 
Proposals should take an interdisciplinary approach, combining SSH disciplines with insights 
from computer science and data analytics. They should integrate a strong data -driven 
approach and could explore aspects such as: 
• Mapping and measuring the compounded effects of conflict, forced displacement, and 
democratic backsliding on access to rights, services, and political participation. 
• Developing new methodologies and indicators to assess the impact of shrinking civic 
space and legal rollbacks on gender and minority rights. 
• Creating data-driven tools or policy dashboards to monitor the evolving risks faced by 
women, LGBTIQ people, and/or various minority groups in authoritarian and post -
conflict settings.   
Proposals should adopt a multi -scalar approach that connects grassroots -level experiences of 
discrimination and exclusion with macro -level geopolitical, legal and policy frameworks. 
Proposals could assess how international and European actors can effectively counter these 
trends through diplomatic efforts, development cooperation, and targeted support for civil 
society. Engaging with policymakers, human rights organisations, and affected communities 
is essential.  
Proposals are encouraged to identify other relevant EU -funded projects, notably in cluster 2 
and 3, and to explore potential collaboration opportunities with them. In order to achieve the 
topic’s expected outcomes, international cooperation is encouraged. 
Where applicable, proposals should leverage the data and services available through European 
Research Infrastructures federated under the European Open Science Cloud (EOSC), as well 
as data from relevant Data Spaces. Particular efforts should be made to ensure that the data 
produced in the context of this topic is FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Re -
usable).
