Research and Training Programme of the European Atomic Energy 
Community (2021-2025) 72. 
The granting authority may, up to 4 years after the end of the action, 
object to a transfer of ownership or to the exclusive licensing of results,

Expected Outcome: Projects should contribute to all of the following expected outcomes: 
•  EU institutions and national decision -makers, civil society organisations and other 
societal actors and citizens at large are better equipped, with new data, knowledge and 
methods, to confront threats and challenges of democracies as well as to enhance their 
inclusiveness and participatory elan. 
• Strengthened citizens’ long -lasting engagement in the democratic life, including but 
going beyond electoral processes, and increased trust in democratic institutions.   
Scope: The Political Guidelines for 2024 -2029 of the European Commission 73 announced a 
new European Democracy Shield. Building on the European Democracy Action Plan 74 and 
 
the Defence of Democracy Package 75 , this initiative aims to safeguard, strengthen and 
promote democracy in the EU and to reinforce public trust. The Democracy Shield will aim to 
reinforce citizens’ participation and engagement in the democratic life, promote free and fair 
elections and support free and independent media. It will also address the increasing threats to 
democratic systems, institutions and processes within the EU, often driven by various hostile 
actors aiming to undermine citizens’ trust in democracy and its institutions. In addition, the 
Commission is also preparing a Civil Society Strategy and has also announced an updated 
strategy on LGBTIQ equality, a new anti -racism strategy, a new gender equality strategy, and 
a roadmap for women’s rights 76 It also continues implementing the Strategy for the rights of 
persons with disabilities 2021 -203077, in line with the United Nations Convention on the 
rights of persons with disabilities, which the EU and its Member States are parties to78. 
Ensuring full, equal and meaningful political participation for everyone, regardless of sex, 
gender, racial or ethnic origin, religion or belief, disability, socioeconomic status, 
employment or age, fosters more stable and resilient democracies. Decision -making processes 
that incorporate a wider range of perspectives and experiences leads to policies that are more 
comprehensive and attuned to the needs of all citizens. 
Under this open topic, proposals should address existing, upcoming or unforeseen challenges 
and/or creative or disruptive solutions for protecting European democracy, enhancing 
citizens’ trust and political participation, expanding inclusiveness and fairness of democratic 
institutions and practices and supporting and protecting civil society. Proposals are 
encouraged to investigate the opportunities offered by digital and other new technological 
solutions, notably from the civic tech sector. Proposals should address unmet research needs, 
complementing previous Horizon Europe calls. 
In that sense, proposals should consider, build on – if appropriate – while not duplicating, 
previous research, including but not limited to, SSH disciplines and/or research by other 
Horizon Europe projects, in particular in the context of this destination. Coordination among 
the successful proposals from this topic should be envisaged to avoid duplication and to 
exploit complementarities as well as opportunities for increased impact. 
Given the multifaceted character of the challenges confronted by democracies, applicants 
should ensure effective interdisciplinary collaborations by building consortia with the 
participation of all relevant disciplines, depending of course on the nature of the selected 
democratic challenge and research angle. 
Applicants are encouraged to adopt innovative approaches, including also by considering 
alternative and complementary models for democratic participation and engagement, 
facilitating the development and potential uptake of solutions. To ensure the active 
 
involvement of and timely feedback from relevant democracy practitioners and policymakers, 
proposals should plan a mid -term deliverable consisting in the assessment of the project’s 
mid-term contributions to the expected outcomes, performed by the democracy practitioners 
and policy -makers. Proposals should directly engage citizens, as well as civil society 
organisations, to enable broader public debate and explore uptake of democratic innovations 
and better anticipate potential risks. 
Proposals are encouraged to collaborate with the JRC Competence Centre on Participatory 
and Deliberative Democracy, particularly with respect to demonstrating how structured 
opportunities for citizen participation strengthen inclusiveness and fairness of democratic 
institutions and practices, and foster evolution in democratic public spaces. 
Where applicable, proposals should leverage the data and services available through European 
Research Infrastructures federated under the European Open Science Cloud (EOSC), as well 
as data from relevant Data Spaces. Particular efforts should be made to ensure that the data 
produced in the context of this topic is FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Re -
usable).
