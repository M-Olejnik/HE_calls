Expected Outcome: Projects should contribute to all of the following expected outcomes: 
• The cultural and creative sectors and industries (CCSI) have access to a dedicated 
European virtual AI support platform. This hub will facilitate collaboration among a 
strong and open network of CCSI networks, professionals, researchers, AI tech 
companies, creative startups, ethical AI experts, rights management infrastructures, other 
industries with a shared interest in the field of AI for culture and creativity and a focus 
on research and innovation. 
 
• The AI4Creatives Support Platform provides easy access to shared services, expertise, 
capacity building, training, and tools needed to design, develop and adopt AI solutions 
tailored to cultural and creative processes and needs, enhancing innovation and 
competitiveness. 
• Filling a gap, the platform enables the development and sharing of AI applications that 
adhere to EU values, principles and regulations, implementing transparency, ethical 
standards, promoting cultural diversity, addressing biases, and ensuring equitable access 
to culture and creativity.   
Scope: This topic addresses the pressing need to coordinate, support, disseminate and 
capitalise on relevant outcomes from Horizon Europe Cluster 2 -funded projects aimed to 
equip CCSI to leverage the digital transformation, from other relevant Horizon Europe 
projects, and from initiatives exploring AI in relation to CCSI under other EU programmes, 
such as the AI Continent Action Plan, (including AI Factories, GenAI4EU, Apply AI and the 
envisaged AI strategy for cultural and creative sectors and industries), AI Innovation package, 
and others. The aim is maximising their impact and driving innovation and competitiveness. 
AI offers significant opportunities for CCSI, but challenges persist, including skill gaps, 
limited interaction with technology partners, structural weaknesses of CCSI, mostly small and 
micro enterprises with weak bargaining power against big tech providers, and limited 
resources to train dedicated AI models. Other challenges relate to AI ethics, transparency and 
intellectual property rights, including copyright. By transcending siloed approaches and 
establishing synergies, CCSI can take advantage of economies of scale, harness AI's potential 
and drive innovation. The goal is establishing a permanent, networked reference point for 
CCSI through a virtual support platform that builds capacity and facilitates networking and 
collaboration among CCSI, stakeholders, researchers, technology developers, AI ethicists, and 
other industries and startups, with the overall aim to enable artists, cultural professionals, 
creative companies and cultural organisations to engage with AI, including dealing with 
biases and risks. The Support Platform is expected to enable the CCSI to access and utilize 
available custom-made tools, quality data, resources, knowledge, training, and AI applications 
aligned with their specific needs and with EU principles and regulations, thus easing the 
adoption of appropriate innovative ethical solutions and approaches tailored to the CCSI. 
Among the possible functions of the Support Platform should be: 
• Disseminate or develop frameworks, standards, best practices, and toolkits serving as 
strategic guidance for integrating ethical AI into CCSI value chains. 
• Facilitate cross -sector collaboration, synergies, and partnerships between CCSI 
professionals, AI tech companies, and startups, liaising with initiatives like the European 
Collaborative Cloud for Cultural Heritage (ECCCH), AI Factories, research 
infrastructures on cultural heritage and digital humanities, European Digital Innovation 
Hubs, ALT EDIC and LLMs4EU, Common European Data Space for Cultural heritage 
and other data spaces, and other EU initiatives in this area. 
• Build and develop a solid copyright infrastructure to support the use and licensing of 
copyright-protected content in the context of AI. 
• Suggest education and training frameworks and provide training to foster effective AI 
use in CCSI. Encourage CCSI and SMEs to engage with available federated data 
sources, digital infrastructures, computational resources, other available platforms to 
develop their own AI-powered products and services. 
• Develop a roadmap for emerging challenges in AI and other emerging technologies 
related to culture and creativity. 
• Engage in policy dialogues with policymakers, industry leaders, and stakeholders to 
emphasize culture's contribution to quality, ethical, and fair AI developments.   
The platform is expected to develop and operate based on a robust sustainability and business 
model, ensuring long -term viability beyond the initial project phase. The business model 
should align with the platform’s objectives, ensuring it remains accessible to diverse 
organisations in terms of size and resources and that funding is not dominated by special 
interest groups. 
The project should liaise with the EIT KIC Culture and Creativity to establish synergies, 
exchange information, and enhance mutual outcomes and impact. It should build on Horizon 
Europe funded projects in the area of AI and CCSI, particularly those funded under topics 
HORIZON-CL2-2025-01-HERITAGE-04: Leveraging artificial intelligence for creativity -
driven innovation, HORIZON -CL2-2026-01-HERITAGE-03: AI integration in CCSI work 
practice: catalysing innovation and competitiveness, HORIZON -CL2-2026-01-HERITAGE-
04: Towards a fair and transparent market for cultural and creative content in the era of 
generative AI, and establish synergies with relevant projects, and initiatives supported by 
other relevant EU programmes, such as Digital Europe, Creative Europe and their successors. 
The project should conduct a pilot of the virtual platform to ensure alignment with CCSI 
needs, assessing technical and operational feasibility to ensure sustainability over time. The 
virtual Support Platform should be fully operational by the project's conclusion.
