Call: Culture, Creativity and Inclusive Society 2026 
Specific conditions 
Expected EU 
contribution per 
project 
The Commission estimates that an EU contribution of between EUR 
3.50 and 4.00 million would allow these outcomes to be addressed 
appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and 
selection of a proposal requesting different amounts. 
Indicative budget The total indicative budget for the topic is EUR 12.00 million. 
Type of Action Research and Innovation Actions 
Procedure The procedure is described in General Annex F. The following 
exceptions apply: 
To ensure a balanced portfolio covering the topic’s different thematic 
areas, grants will be awarded to applications not only in order of 
ranking but at least also to those that are the highest ranked within each 
area provided in the scope (areas A, B, and C), provided that the 
corresponding applications attain all thresholds. Proposals should 
clearly indicate the thematic area(s) they have selected to work on. 
Legal and financial 
set-up of the Grant 
Agreements 
The rules are described in General Annex G. The following exceptions 
apply: 
Eligible costs will take the form of a lump sum as defined in the 
Decision of 7 July 2021 authorising the use of lump sum contributions 
under the Horizon Europe Programme – the Framework Programme for 
Research and Innovation (2021 -2027) – and in actions under the 
Research and Training Programme of the European Atomic Energy 
Community (2021-2025) 32. 
The granting authority may, up to 4 years after the end of the action, 
object to a transfer of ownership or to the exclusive licensing of results, 
as set out in the specific provision of Annex 5. 
 
Expected Outcome: Projects should contribute to all of the following expected outcomes: 
• EU institutions, Member States and decision -makers worldwide, relevant international 
organisations, civil society organisations and other societal actors have a better shared 
understanding of the systemic challenges and the underlying drivers and motivations that 
undermine managing global commons sustainably. 
• EU institutions, Member States and decision -makers worldwide, relevant international 
organisations, as well as academies of science, higher education institutions and 
research-performing organisations are better equipped with the tools needed to improve 
the science-policy interface in the area of foreign and security policies in general, and 
multilateral / national science advisory bodies in the field of foreign policy in particular 
with a recognition of the need to engage citizens in a more participatory and inclusive 
approach to research and policy-making. 
• Rules-based multilateralism is strengthened by the development of concepts, methods, 
processes, and information relevant for decision -making that foster the sustainable 
governance of global commons within the evolving geopolitical context, thereby 
informing also the EU’s science diplomacy actions.   
Scope: Global commons—resources shared by all humanity —are increasingly threatened by 
overuse and degradation by state and non -state actors. Spaces beyond national jurisdiction, in 
particular, require collective management to ensure sustainability for future generations. Not 
doing so will deepen the triple planetary crisis of climate change, biodiversity loss and 
pollution, and possibly lead to cascading and compounding effects and crossing irreversible 
tipping points and planetary boundaries. Evolving geopolitical tensions, weakened 
multilateral cooperation, technological advances, and rising commercial interests from non -
state actors, have intensified pressures on global commons. Declining trust in science further 
complicates efforts to agree on their fair and sustainable governance, risking instability and 
conflict.  
Against the current geopolitical background, there is a need to review the effectiveness of 
existing legal instruments and to accompany with research the implementation of new 
instruments. In addition, there is a need to further enhance the impact of existing and evolving 
 
science-policy fora 33 and their links to relevant conventions and agreements. To this end, 
proposals should perform a comprehensive mapping of actors’ motivations and values on 
societal, corporate and state level that covers different regions and coalitions of countries 
around the world34. 
Research is also needed into how the current governance of global commons affects 
intergenerational justice and human rights, including gender equality and the impact on 
different social groups, and how civil society can be enabled to access information, provide 
knowledge (including Indigenous Peoples and Local Communities knowledge), and 
participate in the governance of global commons. This may include conducting research 
aimed at enhancing citizen engagement and trust in governance processes and efforts, 
exploring motivations and drivers underlying stakeholder positions in multilateral fora. 
Proposals are also encouraged to study the rights of appeal and redress in policies related to 
the global commons, including but not limited to the “rights of nature”. 
The underlying question is how a sustainable governance of global commons can look like in 
a multipolar world with competing hegemonic powers that do not necessarily share a common 
understanding of the merits of cooperation, multilateralism, or even international law. Hence, 
the overall aim of this call is to develop multi- and interdisciplinary concepts and solutions for 
governing the global commons sustainably, including through the use of science diplomacy as 
a soft power and by learning from best practices in the different types of commons, such as 
the Ocean, Antarctica and Outer Space. 
Proposals are encouraged to explore how imbalances in the governance of global commons 
may contribute to geopolitical tensions, including the outbreak of direct conflicts or proxy 
wars, as well as the erosion or violation of human rights. They are also encouraged to 
consider the wider implications of such governance gaps for international stability and the 
rules-based global order. 
Proposals are expected to address one of the following thematic areas: 
Area A: Climate governance . Projects should consider past and current global climate 
governance efforts, including the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change 
and the Paris Agreement, and develop insights for strengthening climate governance, 
considering the current geopolitical context. Specific attention should be given to analysing 
the drivers underlying the reproduction of diverging positions towards climate change among 
stakeholders and possible solutions as well as reinforcing the role of science -policy interfaces 
such as the IPCC and other relevant science -based mechanisms, e.g., through enhanced 
citizen engagement to increase trust. Proposals should inform and develop recommendations 
for EU and global science diplomacy action. 
 
Area B: Biodiversity governance . Projects should consider past and current global 
biodiversity governance efforts, including the Convention on Biological Diversity, related 
Conferences of the Parties and their subsidiary bodies, and the Kunming -Montreal Global 
Biodiversity Framework (GBF). Projects are encouraged to examine in particular the 
integration of rights of appeal and redress in environmental decision -making processes, 
including legal mechanisms to address grievances and ensure accountability, particularly in 
the context of the “rights of nature” and other innovative approaches to environmental justice. 
Taking into account the current geopolitical environment, projects should develop options for 
reinforcing the role of science -policy interfaces such as the IPBES, IPR and other relevant 
science-based mechanisms, including the Global Knowledge Support Service for Biodiversity 
and the Subregional Technical and Scientific Cooperation Support Centres, with the aim of 
informing and developing recommendations for EU and global science diplomacy action. 
This should include a focus on enhancing access to environmental information for citizens 
and civil society organisations to empower biodiversity action, as well as mainstreaming 
gender equality and human rights considerations into biodiversity policy frameworks, in 
alignment with the work of the United Nations Human Rights Council (UN HCHR) on the 
development of human rights norms for biodiversity protection. 
Area C: Governance of spaces beyond national jurisdiction . Projects should provide a 
cross-cutting assessment of how different types of spaces beyond national jurisdiction have 
been governed so far, notably the ocean, polar regions, outer space including the Moon, Low 
Earth Orbit, the use of the radio spectrum, and dark and quiet skies. This may include a 
comparative review of the legal frameworks (e.g., Antarctic Treaty, UN Convention on the 
Law of the Sea, High Seas Treaty, Outer Space Treaty, etc.). Projects should study in a 
holistic, multidisciplinary manner current and emerging pressures on these spaces, with 
specific emphasis on the role of non -state actors and develop approaches to governing these 
spaces sustainably despite geopolitical fragmentation, thereby informing EU science 
diplomacy action. Examples of application include, and are not limited to, the protection of 
deep-sea ecosystems, the management of space debris, or the preservation of a dark and quiet 
sky. 
Research activities should meaningfully involve experts with practical experience in the 
relevant processes and bodies, including policymakers, diplomats, the business sector, 
academia, and civil society, including indigenous rights holders. Engagement with 
international partners is strongly encouraged. Involvement of the EU’s outermost regions is 
particularly welcome for area C. Research should have a multi -, inter- and trans-disciplinary 
systemic perspective, bringing together expertise across natural sciences and engineering as 
well as social sciences and humanities (including history, law, ethics, and other disciplines). 
The selected projects should cooperate with each other to foster synergies and links between 
the different governance frameworks. Proposals are encouraged to identify other relevant EU -
funded projects and to explore potential collaboration opportunities with them.
