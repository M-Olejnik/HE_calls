HORIZON-CL2-2027-01-DEMOCRACY-07: The role of private companies in 
democracy 
Call: Culture, Creativity and Inclusive Society - 2027 
Specific conditions 
Expected EU 
contribution per 
project 
The Commission estimates that an EU contribution of between EUR 
3.50 and 4.00 million would allow these outcomes to be addressed 
appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and 
selection of a proposal requesting different amounts. 
Indicative budget The total indicative budget for the topic is EUR 8.00 million. 
Type of Action Research and Innovation Actions 
Legal and financial The rules are described in General Annex G. The following exceptions 
set-up of the Grant 
Agreements 
apply: 
The granting authority may, up to 4 years after the end of the action, 
object to a transfer of ownership or to the exclusive licensing of results, 
as set out in the specific provision of Annex 5. 
Eligible costs will take the form of a lump sum as defined in the 
Decision of 7 July 2021 authorising the use of lump sum contributions 
under the Horizon Europe Programme – the Framework Programme for 
Research and Innovation (2021 -2027) – and in actions under the 
Research and Training Programme of the European Atomic Energy 
Community (2021-2025) 65. 
 
Expected Outcome: Projects should contribute to all of the following expected outcomes: 
• EU and national policymakers have a better understanding of corporate influence on 
democratic processes and outcomes, including activities through service providers in the 
EU internal market, enabling them to develop strategies to mitigate negative effects and 
promote a more just and inclusive society. 
• EU and national policymakers have access to evidence -based recommendations and 
develop more effective policies and regulations for promoting responsible corporate 
behaviour, rules on integrity and transparency, preventing corruption and protecting 
democratic values. 
• Civil society organizations and citizens have a greater understanding of the complex 
relationships between private companies and democratic governance, enabling them to 
hold corporations and policymakers accountable for their actions.  
Scope: The relationship between private companies66 and democratic governance is becoming 
increasingly complex and contentious. As corporate interests continue to grow in influence, 
this raises concerns about the potential risks and benefits of private sector involvement, 
particularly in policymaking on contentious topics such as climate change adaptation, 
environmental protection, data protection, privacy, civil rights, and the rights of minorities. 
Thus, there is a pressing need to investigate the impact of private sector involvement on 
democratic processes and outcomes, as well as its long -term effects on political inequalities 
and shifts in power dynamics.  
Large corporations and lobbying groups can inform policymaking with valuable evidence and 
expertise, but also potentially exert undue influence that may compromise the public interest. 
 
The implications of corporate power for democratic values, human rights, and the public good 
are far-reaching and require careful examination. 
Moreover, external private actors, such as foreign investors and multinational companies, 
together with influence activities within the EU internal market through service providers (for 
instance lobbying or political advertising) can shape democratic processes and outcomes, and, 
if not conducted responsibly, risk undermining the integrity of democratic debate. 
To address these challenges, research is needed (including by SSH disciplines) to explore the 
complex relationships between private companies, lobbying groups and democratic processes, 
to develop tools to assess democratic impact of corporate practices, and to identify strategies 
to promote responsible corporate behaviour, to uphold transparency and democratic 
accountability of business practices and to ensure that private companies serve the needs of 
democracy and the public good.  
Proposals should investigate the influence of large corporations, business lobbying groups, 
and external actors on democratic processes, exploring the implications of corporate power on 
democratic values, diversity, equality (including age equality), inclusion, human rights, and 
the public interest. This examination should also extend to the impact of private companies on 
multilateral decision-making, including at the EU level, and analyse how corporate interests 
shape decision-making processes at the transnational level. 
Particular attention should be given to the role of corporate lobbying, public -private 
partnerships, the role of corruption, perceived corruption, and undue influence originating 
from the private sector in undermining democratic governance and the public interest. This 
includes examining the potential for corrupt practices to emerge, such as bribery, revolving 
doors, and other forms of undue influence, which can erode trust in institutions and perpetuate 
inequalities. Furthermore, it is essential to investigate direct interferences by corporations that 
go beyond legitimate ways of involvement in public sector decision -making. These 
interferences can take many forms, including artificially spreading or amplifying 
disinformation in order to, influence public opinions, and steering behaviours, contributing to 
the normalization of extremist or polarizing actors and discourses, which can have far -
reaching consequences.  
Proposals are encouraged to critically examine the structural power of capital in shaping 
policy agendas and public discourse, and to consider how this power contrasts with that of 
labour and civil society. Proposals could encourage structured and sustained dialogue among 
business actors, citizens, regulators, and watchdog organizations, with the aim of developing 
inclusive and accountable governance frameworks that reflect diverse interests and promote 
transparency.  
Proposals are encouraged to investigate the influence of private companies on democratic 
governance, such as – but not limited to – the potential risks and benefits of private sector 
involvement in sortition -based citizens' panels and other forms of participatory and 
deliberative democracy processes. 
Proposals should use a gender -sensitive and intersectional approach in their research to 
analyse how the actions of private companies in a democracy impact individuals’ rights 
differently based on their identities.  
Proposals are encouraged to identify other relevant EU -funded projects exploring the role of 
private companies in democracy and consider exploring potential collaboration opportunities 
with them67.
