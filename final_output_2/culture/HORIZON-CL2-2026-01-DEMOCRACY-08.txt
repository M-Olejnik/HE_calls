3.50 and 4.00 million would allow these outcomes to be addressed 
appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and 
selection of a proposal requesting different amounts.

Type of Action Research and Innovation Actions 
Eligibility 
conditions 
The conditions are described in General Annex B. The following 
exceptions apply: 
The Joint Research Centre (JRC) may participate as member of the 
consortium selected for funding as a beneficiary with zero funding, or 
as an associated partner. The JRC will not participate in the preparation 
and submission of the proposal - see General Annex B. 
Legal and financial 
set-up of the Grant 
Agreements 
The rules are described in General Annex G. The following exceptions 
apply: 
Eligible costs will take the form of a lump sum as defined in the 
Decision of 7 July 2021 authorising the use of lump sum contributions 
under the Horizon Europe Programme – the Framework Programme for 
Research and Innovation (2021 -2027) – and in actions under the 
Research and Training Programme of the European Atomic Energy 
Community (2021-2025) 37. 
The granting authority may, up to 4 years after the end of the action, 
object to a transfer of ownership or to the exclusive licensing of results, 
as set out in the specific provision of Annex 5. 
 
 
Expected Outcome: Projects should contribute to all of the following expected outcomes: 
• EU, national and local policymakers possess the necessary knowledge to inform the 
development of election regulations, standards and tools that address the use of digital 
technologies in elections and political campaigns, ensuring their integrity, inclusiveness, 
accessibility, fairness, transparency, and security. 
• Organisations involved in electoral processes develop and implement guidelines for the 
responsible use of digital technologies in elections and political campaigns, aligned with 
EU and national regulations. 
• Enhanced transparency and accountability in AI -powered political campaigns, achieved 
through requirements for AI system audits, data disclosure, transparency regarding 
algorithms and sources of Large Language Models (LLMs), and responsible AI 
development.   
Scope: The integrity of electoral processes in Europe is facing challenges in the digital age. 
The digital transformation of democratic processes has created new avenues for citizen 
engagement, but it also poses significant risks from disinformation to the integrity of electoral 
and other democratic processes. Concerns about foreign interference, exemplified by Russia's 
activities, but also other third countries, have underscored the need for robust measures to 
safeguard the electoral processes, including enhancing cybersecurity and voter verification to 
prevent perceived electoral manipulation. Social media platforms, in particular, have become 
increasingly critical battlegrounds in the fight for public opinion, with AI-powered tools being 
used to artificially amplify and spread disinformation, manipulate public discourse, and 
influence voter behaviour. 
To address these challenges, it is essential to examine the effects of digital technologies on 
public opinion and governance, and investigate the development of ethical AI, transparent 
political advertising, and tools to counter misinformation, disinformation and foreign 
information manipulation and interference (FIMI). This includes exploring the potential of 
digital technologies to transform and improve democratic processes, investigating multi -
stakeholder approaches, with particular attention in fostering dialogue with online platforms, 
media and political parties and movements, as well as strengthening the traditional and new 
media and securing alternative platforms to enhance electoral resilience. 
Proposals should also investigate the risks new technologies pose to democratic integrity, 
particularly through the manipulation of public opinion and electoral processes, while also 
exploring ways to leverage these new technologies to better understand and mitigate these 
threats. Proposals are also encouraged to examine how AI -generated content across media, 
including entertainment media, influence public opinion, social narratives, gender stereotypes 
and norms, and civic engagement. Moreover, proposals may consider strategies for the 
implementation of appropriate cryptographic measures, including the investigation of 
approaches based on post-quantum cryptography. 
The EU institutions have been actively engaged in addressing the key challenges for election 
integrity, including the artificial amplification of disinformation, online platform 
accountability, and the protection of democratic processes. Proposals should take into account 
ongoing political and strategic initiatives, notably the Political Advertising Regulation, the AI 
Act, the Digital Services Act (DSA) election guidelines 38  and the Commission’s 2023 
Recommendation on inclusive and resilient elections, and Code of Conduct on 
Disinformation39. 
The ultimate goal is to understand how to create robust and resilient electoral systems that can 
meet the challenges of the digital age, ensure the safety and integrity of electoral processes, 
and promote free, fair, inclusive, accessible and transparent elections. This requires 
investigating the risks of cyberattacks and foreign interference on electoral processes, 
developing strategies to enhance voting system security and promote election transparency, 
developing early warning systems, effective debunking strategies, and accountability 
measures for platforms. 
Research should have an interdisciplinary approach (including SSH disciplines), bringing 
together a diverse range of stakeholders, including – but not limited to - electoral authorities 
and other national authorities with responsibilities in electoral matters – notably those 
represented in the European Cooperation Network on elections – civil society organisations, 
new and traditional media and digital platforms. 
Projects may also focus on how FIMI can influence political discourse via digital platforms, 
particularly during electoral periods, including in ways that undermine the rights of women, 
LGBTIQ people, persons with disabilities and other underrepresented groups. This also 
involves examining the safety of electoral processes, protecting the integrity of elections, and 
maintaining public trust in the democratic process, with a particular focus on ensuring the 
safety and security of political candidates, especially women and LGBTIQ people and other 
members of minority groups, from violence, intimidation, and harassment. Addressing these 
concerns requires a comprehensive understanding of how AI shapes political campaigns, 
media narratives, public engagement, and the spread of (gendered) disinformation. 
Proposals are encouraged to identify other EU -funded projects related to electoral integrity 
under the Horizon Europe programme (including but not limited to those in the fields of 
cybersecurity and research and development of AI), and complementary funding schemes, 
such as the Citizens, Equality, Rights and Values programme and the Digital Europe 
Programme, and to explore potential collaboration opportunities with them. 
Applicants may consider the participation of the Joint Research Centre (JRC) to leverage its 
broad range of scientific and technical capabilities, including its expertise in digital 
technologies, data science, and cybersecurity, to support the projects’ objectives and enhance 
their overall impact.
