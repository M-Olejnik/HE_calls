Expected Outcome: This topic aims at supporting activities that are enabling or contributing 
to one or several expected impacts of destination “Developing and using new tools, 
technologies and digital solutions for a healthy society”. To that end, proposals under this 
topic should aim to deliver results that are directed at, tailored towards and contributing to 
most of the following expected outcomes: 
• Biomedical scientists from academia and industry will gain access to entire bio -printing 
units designed to regenerate human tissue. 
• Healthcare professionals acquire information on the safe and effective use of equipment 
enabling advanced therapies with bio-printed human tissue. 
• Healthcare providers dispose of tools enabling them to treat conditions of unmet medical 
need. 
• Individual patients will benefit from a personalised approach to their respective medical 
condition thanks to the bio-printed regenerative medicine solution.  
Scope: Tissue-specific functional 3D bio-printing of living cells has made significant progress 
as a new approach for transplantation applications in regenerative medicine. There are 
currently several types of bio -printing technologies under development for the repair of 
different targeted tissues or organs. To fully unleash the potential of bio -printed cell 
constructs for regenerative medicine several bottlenecks still need to be overcome. Various 
studies in pre-clinical models have shown that bio-printed cell constructs or tissues hold great 
promise for regenerative medicine, by allowing autologous tissue grafts being printed thus 
avoiding adverse graft -host reactions. However, translation of such approaches into clinical 
settings (i.e. humans) and their application to internal organs still needs to be investigated and 
demonstrated. Dependant on the actual target site (i.e. the defect tissue or organ in the human 
body) different bio -printing approaches may be preferable. For printing complex tissues and 
especially entire organs an in-vitro approach followed by transplantation is the preferred way. 
“In-situ” bio-printing, sometimes also referred to as “in -vivo”, or as “intraoperative”, reflects 
a bioprinting process performed on a live subject in a surgical setting and has in certain 
instances (e.g. tissue repair) advantages over an in -vitro bio-printing technique followed by 
transplantation. In -situ bio -printing involves direct patterning of bio -inks onto a patient’s 
body at the target site, allowing for precise construction of a site -matching tissue -structure 
within the actual physiological location where regeneration or repair is needed. As such, in -
situ bio -printing allows for high adaptability, reduced risk of contamination, improved cell 
viability, function and host integration. The high cell densities present in the human vital 
organs underscore the importance of bio -inks which contain less additional biomaterials as 
matrix. Hence the bio-printing of cell constructs that comprise native tissue -like cell densities 
may facilitate repair and/or regeneration of defective complex tissues or internal organs. For 
such approaches meticulous engineering of the bio-printing equipment is necessary, involving 
sophisticated micro-surgical instrumentation and medical imaging platforms. To achieve the 
desired function and to mimic the natural cues in native tissues for in -vitro printed bio -
constructs, the use of additional stimuli is needed, whereas in -situ approaches normally rely 
on the body as natural bioreactor providing the necessary extracellular cues. Recently, 
combinations of in -situ bio -printing with real -time stimuli have been investigated, even for 
the repair of internal organs. However, there remain bottlenecks that need to be overcome, 
like the integration with existing imaging modalities and surgical procedures or the long -time 
stability and functionality of the created bio-constructs. 
To address these challenges, researchers should work in multidisciplinary teams with 
engineers, biomedical scientists, cell biologists and medical doctors. Proposals should be 
based on the use of human cells and address all the following activities: 
• Develop or improve existing bioprinting equipment that comprises all steps of the bio -
printing suite to print bio -constructs with high cell -density for improved vascularisation 
and faster repair of the defect in the body. 
• Scale-up the chosen bio -printing technology to a Good Manufacturing Practices 
(GMP)398 conform/compliant manufacturing process. 
• Perform all necessary regulatory work enabling the conduct of clinical studies and assess 
the clinical value of the developed bio-printing technology in first in-human studies.  
Priority should be given to bio -printing approaches that either target vital internal organs 
followed by surgical grafting or employ in -situ approaches depositing the cell -laden bioink 
directly from the printhead or endoscope on the defect target site in the body. 
Regulatory knowledge of the field is desired and should be documented through contacts with 
relevant national or international European regulatory authorities. A good understanding of 
the different steps involved and the inherent risks in each of these steps will be a basis to 
identify appropriate safety and quality requirements. Requirements from the different 
established EU frameworks on Substances of Human Origin (SoHO), medical devices and 
pharmaceuticals including Advanced Therapy Medicinal Products (ATMPs) should be 
considered for manufacturing/preparation as well as for clinical outcome monitoring. A 
combination of requirements from different frameworks might be most appropriate to allow 
for responsible and fast uptake. 
Proposals under this topic may address any therapeutic area, i.e. any disease, dysfunction or 
defect. Sex differences at the cellular level should be taken into consideration. 
Preclinical stage and clinical development are eligible. The involvement of small and 
medium-sized enterprises (SMEs)399 is encouraged. 
The European Commission's Joint Research Centre (JRC) may contribute to the proposals 
selected for funding with work on strategic technologies for economic security and innovative 
industrial ecosystems, particularly activities on innovation in vitro biotechnologies. 
Applicants should provide details of their clinical studies 400 in the dedicated annex using the 
template provided in the submission system. As proposals under this topic are expected to 
include clinical studies, the use of the template is strongly encouraged.
