HORIZON-HLTH-2027-02-DISEASE-14-two-stage: Clinical trials for advancing 
innovative interventions for neurodegenerative diseases 
Call: Cluster 1 - Health (Two stage - 2027) 
Specific conditions 
Expected EU 
contribution per 
The Commission estimates that an EU contribution of around EUR 
10.00 million would allow these outcomes to be addressed 
 
project appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and 
selection of a proposal requesting different amounts. 
Indicative budget The total indicative budget for the topic is EUR 39.30 million. 
Type of Action Research and Innovation Actions 
Admissibility

threshold will be 12. 
Procedure The procedure is described in General Annex F. The following 
exceptions apply: 
The first-stage proposals of this topic will be evaluated blindly. 
Legal and financial 
set-up of the Grant 
The rules are described in General Annex G. The following exceptions 
apply: 
Agreements The granting authority may, up to 4 years after the end of the action, 
object to a transfer of ownership or to the exclusive licensing of results, 
as set out in the specific provision of Annex 5. 
 
Expected Outcome: This topic aims at supporting activities that are enabling or contributing 
to one or several expected impacts of destination “Tackling diseases and reducing disease 
burden”. To that end, proposals under this topic should aim to deliver results that are directed 
at, tailored towards and contributing to all the following expected outcomes: 
• The scientific and clinical communities make effective use of state-of-the-art knowledge, 
data, technologies, tools, methods, best practices, and trainings to underpin and 
complement the development of innovative interventions aimed at more effective 
treatments for neurodegenerative diseases. 
• The scientific and clinical communities benefit from the exchange of data, knowledge 
and best practices, thereby strengthening their collaboration in the EU, the Associated 
Countries and beyond. 
• The scientific and clinical communities make wide use of relevant databases and/or 
integrate them with existing infrastructures for storage and sharing of collected data 
according to FAIR286 principles, thereby encouraging further use of the data. 
• Policymakers, funders, scientific and clinical communities, patient organisations, 
regulators, and other relevant bodies are informed of the research advances made and the 
requirements for a widespread implementation of the innovative therapeutic 
interventions and complementary approaches. 
• Patients and caregivers are constructively engaged with the research, ensuring that their 
needs are catered for, with the aim of tangibly benefitting from the interventions.  
Scope: Neurodegenerative diseases are a high burden for patients, caregivers, health systems 
and society. Given the limitations with current therapeutic solutions, including that they 
primarily address symptoms rather than underlying causes and can have serious side effects, 
together with the increasing prevalence of neurodegenerative diseases in an aging population, 
there is a huge need to develop more innovative, safer and more effective therapeutic 
solutions for these diseases. To further enhance their safety and effectiveness, the therapeutic 
solution based on an active substance should be combined/complemented with another 
multidisciplinary approach (e.g. lifestyle changes, cognitive training, rehabilitation therapies). 
Together this innovative intervention should lead to an improved quality of life and reduce the 
societal impact of these diseases. 
Rare neurodegenerative diseases are excluded287. 
 
Proposals should address most of the following aspects: 
• Perform rigorous early -stage 288  clinical trials into the safety and efficacy of the 
innovative interventions and their mode of administration, ensuring adequate 
cohorts/sample sizes with adequate representation of the patient population, including in 
terms of age, sex and ethnicity. 
• Through the clinical trials and to the extent possible of additional studies, gain further 
insight into the potentially novel mechanism(s) of action of the innovative therapies and 
complementary approaches. This could entail analyses of imaging (e.g. MRI, ultrasound, 
nuclear imaging), as well as physiological, molecular, biochemical or omics signatures 
revealing potential perturbations prior to the intervention and recovery/improvement 
thereafter, and it could lead to the development of surrogate endpoints. This insight 
should open the path to more personalised interventions and approaches. 
• Use and/or develop technologies, including digital ones (e.g. (generative) Artificial 
Intelligence - AI289, wearable technologies) to help implement and monitor the long-term 
efficacy of the intervention(s), as well as manage the disorder and/or monitor their 
progression (e.g. with unobtrusive technologies suitable for patient monitoring at home 
and in real -world conditions), whilst also ensuring they are bias -free, inclusive, and 
ethically sound. 
• Utilise existing data, biobanks, registries and/or cohorts, together with the generation of 
new data that should be managed in line with the FAIR principles. 
• Engage all relevant stakeholders (especially patients and patients’ representatives for the 
disease, caregivers, clinicians, counsellors, regulators, etc.) to design end -user optimised 
interventions, applying gender-sensitive and intersectional approaches. 
• Advance research by leveraging already existing and emerging state -of-the-art research 
infrastructures (e.g. EuroBioImaging 290 , European Genomic Data Infrastructure 291 , 
ECRIN292, EATRIS293, EBRAINS294, BBMRI295, etc.), as well as results stemming from 
EU-supported research projects, where applicable296. 
 
• Engage with national public health authorities and regulators to ensure a robust 
development pathway and further uptake of the intervention.  
The participation of start -ups, micro, small and medium -sized enterprises (SMEs) 297  is 
encouraged with the aim of strengthening their scientific and technological foundations, 
enhancing their innovation potential, and exploring possibilities for commercial exploitation. 
Funded projects should liaise with the future co -funded European Partnership for Brain 
Health298 (covered by topic HORIZON-HLTH-2025-02-DISEASE-01: “European Partnership 
for Brain Health”) once launched. 
The topic requires the effective contribution of social sciences and humanities (SSH) 
disciplines and the involvement of SSH experts, institutions as well as the inclusion of 
relevant SSH expertise, in order to produce meaningful and significant effects enhancing the 
societal impact of the related research activities. 
All projects funded under this topic are strongly encouraged to participate in networking and 
joint activities, as appropriate. Therefore, proposals should include a budget for the attendance 
to regular joint meetings and may consider covering the costs of any other potential joint 
activities without the prerequisite to detail concrete joint activities at this stage. The details of 
these joint activities will be defined during the grant agreement preparation phase. 
Applicants should provide details of their clinical studies 299 in the dedicated annex using the 
template provided in the submission system. As proposals under this topic are expected to 
include clinical studies, the use of the template is strongly encouraged.
