against pathogens resistant to antimicrobials 
Call: Cluster 1 - Health (Single stage - 2027/1) 
Specific conditions 
Expected EU 
contribution per 
project 
The Commission estimates that an EU contribution of between EUR 
8.00 and 10.00 million would allow these outcomes to be addressed 
appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and 
selection of a proposal requesting different amounts. 
Indicative budget The total indicative budget for the topic is EUR 44.20 million. 
Type of Action Research and Innovation Actions 
Eligibility 
conditions 
The conditions are described in General Annex B. The following 
exceptions apply: 
In recognition of the opening of the US National Institutes of Health’s 
programmes to European researchers, any legal entity established in the 
United States of America is eligible to receive Union funding. 
If projects use satellite -based earth observation, positioning, navigation 
and/or related timing data and services, beneficiaries must make use of 
Copernicus and/or Galileo/EGNOS (other data and services may 
additionally be used). 
 
Award criteria The criteria are described in General Annex D. The following 
exceptions apply: 
The thresholds for each criterion will be 4 (Excellence), 4 (Impact) and 
4 (Implementation). The cumulative threshold will be 12. 
Procedure The procedure is described in General Annex F. The following 
exceptions apply: 
To ensure a balanced project portfolio covering the pathogens targeted 
in this topic 265 , grants will be awarded (within available budget) to 
proposals not only in order of ranking but at least also to those proposals 
that are the highest ranked within different pathogens targeted, provided 
that the proposals attain all thresholds. 
Legal and 
financial set-up of 
the Grant 
Agreements 
The rules are described in General Annex G. The following exceptions 
apply: 
The granting authority may, up to 4 years after the end of the action, 
object to a transfer of ownership or to the exclusive licensing of results, 
as set out in the specific provision of Annex 5. 
 
Expected Outcome: This topic aims at supporting activities that are enabling or contributing 
to one or several expected impacts of destination “Tackling diseases and reducing disease 
burden”. To that end, proposals under this topic should aim to deliver results that are directed 
at, tailored towards and contributing to all the following expected outcomes: 
• The scientific and clinical communities have a better understanding of and access to new 
and innovative products for the treatment of antimicrobial resistant bacteria and fungi, as 
well as for further clinical investigation. 
• Candidate therapies are available to treat patients for antimicrobial resistant bacteria and 
fungi, increasing therapeutic options for clinical deployment in the fight against 
Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR).  
Scope: The rapid rise of AMR presents a formidable threat to public health, challenging our 
ability to treat infections that were once easily managed with standard antimicrobials. As 
pathogens continually adapt and develop resistance to existing drugs, the efficacy of these 
treatments diminishes, leading to more severe and prolonged illnesses, increased healthcare 
costs and productivity losses, and higher mortality rates. This escalating crisis underscores an 
urgent need for viable therapeutic alternatives required to reduce the burden of diseases 
caused by antibiotic resistance. Innovative solutions are crucial to maintaining effective 
disease management and safeguarding public health. 
Proposals should pursue the development of innovative and effective antibacterial and 
antifungal agents, including antibody -based therapies, which meet at least one of the four 
 
World Health Organization (WHO) innovation criteria 266, namely: i) new chemical class, ii) 
new target, iii) new mode of action and iv) no evidence of cross-resistance. 
This topic contributes to strengthening the Research and Innovation ecosystem within the EU 
and supports the implementation of the European Medical Countermeasures Strategy 267 and 
the forthcoming Critical Medicines Act268. 
Proposals under this topic should not pursue the development of phage-therapies. 
Applicants should explicitly state in their proposal which of the following pathogens is 
targeted and the proposed work should address only this specific pathogen. The proposed 
work should pursue the development of existing therapeutic candidates targeting exclusively 
one of the following pathogens:   
i. Carbapenem resistant Acinetobacter baumanii (CRAB) 
ii. Carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales (CRE) and third -generation cephalosporin -
resistant Enterobacterales (C3GRE) 
iii. Carbapenem resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa 
iv. Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) 
v. (Drug)-resistant Aspergillus fumigatus 
vi. (Drug)-resistant Candida spp  
Identifying a specific pathogen does not preclude the exploration of these candidates' effects 
on other bacteria or fungi. Proposals should thus aim to accelerate testing of novel candidates 
in human trials, diversify and accelerate the global prophylactic and therapeutic research and 
development portfolio for AMR bacterial and fungal infections, and to strengthen the leading 
role of the EU in prophylactic and therapeutic research and development. 
Proposals should address all the following areas: 
• If necessary, finalisation of in -vivo tests in at least one animal model or, if available in 
humanised immune system animal models, to demonstrate the protective function of the 
therapeutics deemed sufficient for moving to first clinical trials. 
• If requested by regulators as pre -requisite for clinical studies, in -vivo tests in a non -
human primate model. 
• Production of batches of the most promising antimicrobials candidates according to the 
Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP)269. 
 
• In human clinical safety and efficacy studies, demonstrating a clear regulatory pathway 
for market authorisation. Attention should be paid to critical biological and social factors 
such as sex, age, ethnicity, disability and vulnerability.  
Participation of third countries where AMR bacteria and fungi in the proposal are endemic or 
where outbreaks have occurred or are ongoing is encouraged. 
The participation of start -ups, micro, small and medium -sized enterprises (SMEs) 270  is 
encouraged with the aim of strengthening their scientific and technological foundations, 
enhancing their innovation potential, and exploring possibilities for commercial exploitation. 
All projects funded under this topic are expected to engage with regulatory bodies in a timely 
manner to ensure adequacy of the actions from a regulatory point of view. 
Proposals should advance research by leveraging already existing and emerging state -of-the-
art research initiatives such as the co -funded European Partnership on One Health Anti -
Microbial Resistance (EUP OHAMR)271. 
Applicants should provide details of their clinical studies 272 in the dedicated annex using the 
template provided in the submission system. As proposals under this topic are expected to 
include clinical studies, the use of the template is strongly encouraged.
