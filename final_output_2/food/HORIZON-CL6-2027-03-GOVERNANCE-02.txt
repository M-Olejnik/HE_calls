HORIZON-CL6-2027-03-GOVERNANCE-02: Improving analytical capacity for 
sustainable competitiveness of the agricultural sector 
Call: Call 03 - single stage (2027) 
Specific conditions 
Expected EU The Commission estimates that an EU contribution of around EUR 6.00 
contribution per 
project 
million would allow these outcomes to be addressed appropriately. 
Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of a 
proposal requesting different amounts. 
Indicative budget The total indicative budget for the topic is EUR 6.00 million. 
Type of Action Research and Innovation Actions 
Eligibility 
conditions 
The conditions are described in General Annex B. The following 
exceptions apply: 
The following additional eligibility criteria apply: the proposals must 
apply the multi -actor approach. See definition of the multi -actor 
approach in this work programme part. 
The Joint Research Centre (JRC) may participate as member of the 
consortium selected for funding as a beneficiary with zero funding, or 
as an associated partner. The JRC will not participate in the preparation 
and submission of the proposal - see General Annex B. 
Legal and financial 
set-up of the Grant 
Agreements 
The rules are described in General Annex G. The following exceptions 
apply: 
Eligible costs will take the form of a lump sum as defined in the 
Decision of 7 July 2021 authorising the use of lump sum contributions 
under the Horizon Europe Programme – the Framework Programme for 
Research and Innovation (2021 -2027) – and in actions under the 
Research and Training Programme of the European Atomic Energy 
Community (2021-2025) 356. 
 
Expected Outcome: Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected 
outcomes: 
• farmers and other decision makers of the agri -food supply chains have a better 
understanding of the determinants of competitiveness, and the interactions with the 
sustainability dimensions (economic, social, environmental, including biodiversity 
protection and climate change mitigation and adaptation); 
• farmers, policy makers and other decision makers of the agri -food supply chains benefit 
from improved collection and access to data and analytical tools, enabling better -
informed decisions conciliating competitiveness, sustainability and resilience objectives; 
• policy makers are better equipped to develop evidence-based policies.  
 
Scope: The agri-food sector is an important pillar to EU competitiveness. It is composed of 
diversified businesses representing around 15% of total EU employment and contributes to 
provide essential services and secure a stable and affordable supply of food to EU citizens. 
The concept of agricultural competitiveness is complex and approached with different 
perspectives and methodologies in the scientific literature. EU policies aim at addressing a 
growing number of objectives in a challenging and evolving context (e.g., climate change, 
biodiversity loss, geopolitical tensions, fast digitalisation). There is a need to update 
knowledge and tools on agricultural competitiveness. This should contribute to improve our 
capacity to design and implement agricultural policies, effective in navigating and addressing 
multiple objectives while enabling green and digital transitions without undermining our 
competitiveness over time. Successful proposals under this topic should support the EU 
Vision for Agriculture and Food, the Competitiveness Compass, the Common Agricultural 
Policy, the sustainability objectives (including on climate and biodiversity) of the Green Deal, 
and the SDGs. 
Proposals should: 
• address analytical gaps on competitiveness to better account for their various drivers, 
inputs (including land, labour, capital), components (e.g., costs, price, innovation 
capacity, investment capacity, market share, market position, resilience, knowledge, 
skills, productivity, product quality, differentiation) and impacts (economic, 
environmental and social). Consider various value chains and farming systems in 
different regions, one of which should be organic farming. This activity should integrate 
knowledge from different disciplines (e.g., economics, management, agronomy, 
environmental sciences); 
• improve the capacity to analyse agriculture -related policies supporting and recognising 
sustainable practices (such as supporting climate, biodiversity, and sustainable 
development goals) across the value chain (e.g., due diligence, deforestation -free 
products) and in trade agreements, in particular their capacity to support competitiveness 
and resilience objectives, and to mitigate leakage effects; 
• provide evidence on the social, economic and environmental drivers of competitiveness, 
synergies, trade -offs between the sustainability dimensions, at and between different 
stages of the value chain (including farm -level, producer organisations, upstream and 
downstream operators etc.) as well as spatial (local to global) and time scales (short to 
long term). Proposals are encouraged to consider different lengths of value chains (e.g., 
short, mid-tier, global), business strategies (e.g., economies of scale, specialisation and 
agglomeration vs economies of scope) and marketing strategies (e.g., quality 
differentiation); 
• identify, improve and/or develop adequate indicators and metrics, and collect the 
necessary data, to improve the measurement of performance, sustainability, resilience, 
productivity and competitiveness in analytical tools. This work should take into account 
the practical needs of decision -makers and the context of their operations (e.g., 
international versus local strategy). Particular attention should be paid to prioritising 
relevant robust indicators that could be replicated in different countries; 
• provide recommendations and propose levers to anticipate trade -offs and conciliate 
competitiveness, resilience and sustainability objectives in business strategies and 
policies and support the long-term prosperity of the agricultural sector.  
Proposals should capitalise on existing relevant research findings and tools and ensure 
complementarities with other relevant EU -funded projects. Proposals should also ensure 
synergies with other relevant EU -funded studies, projects, initiatives and processes (e.g., 
competitiveness check). 
The JRC’s participation could involve contributing to scenario assessment with the iMAP 
modelling platform, sharing of information and contribution to dissemination of results. 
Proposals must implement the multi -actor approach, with a consortium based on a balanced 
mix of actors with complementary knowledge, including farmers, researchers, businesses and 
other relevant actors from agri-food supply chains. 
International cooperation is encouraged, in particular with Mediterranean countries. 
This topic should involve the effective contribution of Social Sciences and Humanities (SSH) 
disciplines.
