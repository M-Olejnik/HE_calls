HORIZON-CL6-2026-02-FARM2FORK-12: Leveraging R&I knowledge on 
microbiome 
Call: Call 02 - single stage (2026) 
Specific conditions 
Expected EU 
contribution per 
project 
The Commission estimates that an EU contribution of around EUR 2.00 
million would allow these outcomes to be addressed appropriately. 
Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of a 
proposal requesting different amounts. 
Indicative budget The total indicative budget for the topic is EUR 2.00 million. 
Type of Action Coordination and Support Actions 
Legal and financial 
set-up of the Grant 
Agreements 
The rules are described in General Annex G. The following exceptions 
apply: 
Eligible costs will take the form of a lump sum as defined in the 
Decision of 7 July 2021 authorising the use of lump sum contributions 
under the Horizon Europe Programme – the Framework Programme for 
Research and Innovation (2021 -2027) – and in actions under the 
Research and Training Programme of the European Atomic Energy 
Community (2021-2025) 172. 
 
Expected Outcome: Project results are expected to contribute to all the following expected 
outcomes: 
• provides a microbiome one -stop-shop containing resources and knowledge (information 
on microbiome R&I landscape, databases, best practices, risk assessments and food 
safety, aspects related to the environment and biodiversity, policy briefs…) for 
stakeholders involved in microbiome R&I (researchers, policymakers and regulators); 
• guidance for policymakers focusing on the integrated link between microbiome and its 
interconnection with human health, climate, environment, agriculture and food systems 
(emphasising the One Health perspective); 
• enhanced integration and coordination between member states and associated countries 
on microbiome research and innovation within a One Health context, encompassing all 
kinds of microbiomes.  
Scope: Microbiome research, adopting a holistic approach through a One Health perspective, 
has gained traction recently but research remains fragmented and there is a need for a 
 
coordination body that monitors research in this sector and steer research efforts in a 
strategical direction. Nevertheless, regulatory requirements remain one of the biggest 
challenges translating microbiome research to innovative solutions and such body would 
reinsure continuity of regulatory harmonisation efforts, conducted by previous and existing 
initiatives. 
The topic is relevant to the EU policies related to the Commission communication on: 
Building the future with nature: Boosting Biotechnology and Biomanufacturing in the EU, the 
EU life science strategy, the EU biodiversity strategy for 2030, the zero pollution action plan, 
the EU strategy on research and technology infrastructure, the R&I food 2030 framework, and 
the digital transition policies (e.g., AI Act, etc). 
Proposals should address all the following activities: 
• establishment of a hub acting as a resource centre and a monitoring body of the 
microbiome R&I and regulatory landscape; fostering and strengthening synergies 
between existing coordination efforts and national initiatives in alignment with EU 
microbiome initiatives; 
• mapping of all ongoing and past EU -based microbiome projects, EU research and 
technology infrastructures, and EU initiatives (public and private); identify overlaps, 
synergies, and gaps across all microbiome domains notably to inform future funding and 
policy directions; 
• collaborating with relevant ongoing initiatives (e.g. the World Microbiome Partnership), 
EU-funded projects (e.g. HORIZON -CL6-2026-02-FARM2FORK-11), and build on 
outcomes of legacy EU microbiome projects, among others, to ensure coordinated 
action, avoid duplication of efforts, build on existing achievements, and foster financial 
synergies by identifying microbiome R&I funding gaps; 
• monitoring and assessing the microbiome R&I impact on the population, the 
environment, biodiversity, the EU economy and competitiveness through specific 
indicators targeting EU and national policies priorities with an emphasis on One Health 
principles and across all microbiome types.
