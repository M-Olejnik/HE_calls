management of invasive alien species 
Call: Call 01 - single stage (2027) 
Specific conditions 
Expected EU 
contribution per 
project 
The Commission estimates that an EU contribution of around EUR 
8.00 million would allow these outcomes to be addressed 
appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and 
selection of a proposal requesting different amounts. 
Indicative budget The total indicative budget for the topic is EUR 24.00 million. 
Type of Action Research and Innovation Actions 
Eligibility conditions The conditions are described in General Annex B. The following 
exceptions apply: 
The Joint Research Centre (JRC) may participate as member of the 
consortium selected for funding as a beneficiary with zero funding, or 
as an associated partner. The JRC will not participate in the 
preparation and submission of the proposal - see General Annex B. 
Legal and financial 
set-up of the Grant 
Agreements 
The rules are described in General Annex G. The following 
exceptions apply: 
Beneficiaries may provide financial support to third parties. The 
support to third parties can only be provided in the form of grants. The 
maximum amount to be granted to each third party is EUR 60 000. 
 
Expected Outcome: Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected 
outcomes: 
• the capacities and integrated governance of researchers, decision-makers, practitioners, 
local communities and other stakeholders to effectively collaborate to prevent, eradicate 
or manage invasive alien species (IAS) are enhanced; 
• native ecosystems are better protected, leading to improved resilience and continuous 
provision of ecosystem services including for climate mitigation and adaptation.  
Scope: Invasive alien species are one of the five main direct drivers of biodiversity loss. 
Besides inflicting major damage to nature and the economy, many invasive alien species also 
facilitate the outbreak and spread of infectious diseases, posing a threat to humans and native 
wildlife. The rate of new introductions of invasive alien species has increased in recent years. 
Without effective control measures, risks to our nature and health will continue to rise. 
Climate change and land -use changes facilitate the spread and establishment of many alien 
species. 
Proposals are expected to support the prevention, eradication and/or management of invasive 
alien species by stakeholders, including adaptive management approaches. This topic is 
related to target 12 the EU biodiversity strategy for 2030 (50% reduction in the number of 
Red List species threatened by invasive alien species) and to target 6 of the Kunming -
Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework: reduce the introduction of Invasive Alien Species 
by 50% by 2030 and minimize their impact. Proposals should support the implementation of 
the EU Nature Restoration Regulation, the EU regulation on invasive alien species and the 
Marine Strategy Framework Directive. Proposals should seek to address some knowledge 
gaps identified by the IPBES assessment on invasive alien species (2023) 119. All ecosystem 
types (terrestrial, fresh and/or marine waters) may be addressed. 
Living labs can empower the green transition by co -creating solutions and involving actors in 
real life settings at territorial level to achieve large-scale impact. 
Successful proposals should: 
• set up at least three living labs, composed each of 10 to 20 experimental sites, following 
the three main principles: (a) co -creation with a large set of stakeholders, (b) carried out 
in real -life settings and (c) involving the end -users. Transboundary living labs are 
encouraged and living labs are expected to be located in at least three different EU 
Member States and/or Associated Countries; 
• establish a detailed work plan of the activities to be undertaken in a transdisciplinary 
way, ensuring the co -design, co-development, and co-implementation of locally adapted 
innovative solutions. Where appropriate, activities should advance knowledge on 
invasive alien species to support the development of solutions; 
 
• conduct participatory and transdisciplinary research and innovation in living labs with 
the objectives of:        
 building on existing methods (including ensuring the integration of existing 
solutions) or developing new ones for detecting and monitoring invasive alien 
species, such as the use of citizen science, eDNA, remote sensing and machine 
learning algorithms, and test them at scale. Proposals could build on pilots 
developed by the European partnership Biodiversa+;    
 designing and testing innovative eradication and management strategies and 
methods which may include, for instance, physical removal and the use of 
biological control or chemical control. Innovative tools such as bio -engineering 
might be explored in conjunction with more traditional methods. Range shifts 
induced by climate change should be considered;   
• monitor and carry out an assessment of the innovative strategies, methods and tools and 
their effectiveness. Measures to ensure the prevention of re -invasion should be 
considered as well, to secure the continued effectiveness of the proposed solutions; 
• disseminate the newly developed solutions, to facilitate their uptake by practitioners; 
• provide data and experience usable for decision -makers, to assess socio -economic 
impacts of invasive alien species, side -effects of the management, the cost of inaction 
and the benefits of eradication or effective management, with effective contribution from 
social sciences and humanities; 
• address challenges with scaling up and transferability of solutions. A gender -sensitive 
and inclusive approach should be integrated, examining how invasive alien species affect 
individuals’ livelihoods and well-being differently.  
This topic requires the effective contribution of SSH discipline to enhance the societal impact 
of the research activities. 
Concrete efforts should be made to ensure that the data produced in the context of the funded 
projects is FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Re -usable), particularly for real -
time data feeds, exploring workflows that can provide “FAIR-by-design” data, i.e., data that is 
FAIR from its generation. Possibilities offered by the European Open Science Cloud (EOSC) 
to store and give access to research data should be considered. A citizen science approach 
could be appropriate for this action to produce, collect and analyse data. 
Financial support to third parties (FSTP) to facilitate active involvement of small actors (e.g. 
land managers, SMEs or civil society) in one or more of the living labs of a project, can be 
provided through calls. A maximum of 30% of the EU funding should be allocated to this 
purpose. 
Proposals should cooperate with the Joint Research Centre to use the resources of and make 
results available to, when relevant, the European Alien Species Information Network 
(EASIN). 
Proposals should ensure cooperation with relevant initiatives of the European partnership 
Biodiversa+ and foresee appropriate resources to ensure close cooperation with the EC 
Knowledge Centre for Biodiversity (KCBD) and its Science Service. 
Proposals are encouraged to consider, where relevant, the data, expertise and services offered 
by European research infrastructures120 as well as related projects in the environment domain. 
International cooperation is encouraged.
