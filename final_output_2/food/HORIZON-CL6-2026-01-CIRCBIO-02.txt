HORIZON-CL6-2026-01-CIRCBIO-02: Advancing recycling technologies for mixed 
post-consumer textiles waste from blended products  
Call: Call 01 - single stage (2026) 
Specific conditions 
Expected EU 
contribution per 
project 
The Commission estimates that an EU contribution of between EUR 
5.00 and 6.00 million would allow these outcomes to be addressed 
appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and 
selection of a proposal requesting different amounts. 
Indicative budget The total indicative budget for the topic is EUR 11.00 million. 
Type of Action Innovation Actions 
Technology 
Readiness Level 
Activities are expected to achieve TRL 6 -8 by the end of the project – 
see General Annex B. Activities may start at any TRL. 
Legal and financial 
set-up of the Grant 
Agreements 
The rules are described in General Annex G. The following exceptions 
apply: 
Eligible costs will take the form of a lump sum as defined in the 
Decision of 7 July 2021 authorising the use of lump sum contributions 
under the Horizon Europe Programme – the Framework Programme for 
Research and Innovation (2021 -2027) – and in actions under the 
Research and Training Programme of the European Atomic Energy 
Community (2021-2025) 228. 
 
Expected Outcome: Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected 
outcomes: 
• European textiles manufacturers have access to novel technologies for fibre -to-fibre 
recycling of post-consumer textile waste; 
• local authorities and consumers benefit from resource - and cost -efficient waste 
management of post-consumer blended textiles; 
• European recyclers are equipped with properly characterised mixed post -consumer 
textile waste.   
Scope: The topic aims at improved management of the end -of-life phase of textile products. 
Textiles are the fourth highest -pressure category for the use of primary raw materials and 
water and fifth for GHG emissions and a major source of microplastic pollution in production 
 
and use phases. They are also a key material and product stream in the circular economy 
action plan. Proposals are expected to demonstrate and deploy innovative solutions for 
increased quality, non -toxicity and durability of secondary textile materials and their 
processing and treatments. 
Proposals should: 
• address textile consumer products made of fibre blends (e.g. polycotton, or other blends 
of multiple materials in combination such as synthetic, semi-synthetic and natural); 
• demonstrate and test novel and marketable solutions for post -consumer textile waste 
(apparel and home textiles) enabling its effective end -of-life collection, sorting and 
recycling (fibre-to-fibre), possibly including biotech solutions; 
• demonstrate and test innovative techniques for effectively disassembling complex 
products, separating multi -material layers and fibre blends and removal of non -textile 
components, coatings or contaminants to facilitate efficient recycling processes; 
• assess the recyclability limits of textiles by determining the number of recycling cycles a 
fibre can undergo. When further fibre -to-fibre recycling is no longer viable, alternative 
applications should be explored to extend the material's value. Solutions should address 
recycling of products made of natural fibres (e.g., cotton) or/and semi -synthetic fibres, 
i.e. modified natural fibres (e.g. viscose), blended with synthetic fibres, ensuring optimal 
resource efficiency and minimizing waste throughout the textile lifecycle; 
• characterize post -consumer textile waste in order to define appropriate management 
practices in particular if the technology is developed within an industrial and urban 
symbiosis; 
• advance recycling technologies that remove persistent chemicals (e.g. PFAS) from post -
consumer textile waste which may harm human health and the environment, and that 
minimise the release of hazardous chemicals and microplastics during the recycling 
process.  
A lifecycle perspective using LCA and LCC should be used when validating the technical and 
economic feasibility of the developed, improved, demonstrated and up -scaled processes. For 
comparability reasons, LCAs should use well -established methods and be based on PEF 
wherever feasible. Proposals should fully incorporate the Safe and Sustainable by Design 
(SSbD) approach. 
Proposals are expected to contribute to the objectives of the Textiles of the Future partnership 
and to build on/coordinate with EU projects funded under the partnership and previous textile-
related Horizon Europe calls. Clustering with other relevant Horizon Europe projects is 
encouraged. 
The topic supports the European Green Deal, the Ecodesign for Sustainable Products 
Regulation and its working plan, the EU Strategy for Sustainable and Circular Textiles, the 
Waste Framework Directive, the Zero Pollution Action Plan, the upcoming Circular Economy 
Act and contributes to Europe’s efforts to develop a single market for sustainable products. It 
also contributes to the Start-ups and Scale-ups strategy.
