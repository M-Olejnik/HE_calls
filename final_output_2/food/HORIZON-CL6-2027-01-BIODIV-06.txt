The rules are described in General Annex G. The following exceptions 
apply: 
Eligible costs will take the form of a lump sum as defined in the 
Decision of 7 July 2021 authorising the use of lump sum contributions 
under the Horizon Europe Programme – the Framework Programme for

Research and Training Programme of the European Atomic Energy 
Community (2021-2025) 123. 
 
 
Expected Outcome: Project results are expected to contribute to all the following expected 
outcomes: 
• society and decision -makers are provided with enhanced governance frameworks that 
integrate knowledge across ecosystems (terrestrial, freshwater and marine) and/or 
societal challenges, helping overcome institutional barriers, power asymmetries, and 
policy fragmentation to accelerate transformative change towards a nature positive 
economy and support EU climate goals; 
• practitioners and public authorities co-create and have access to living labs as innovation 
hubs for testing, and scaling both governance and socio -economic models that integrate 
diverse knowledge systems, actively engage stakeholders and support bottom -up and 
participatory approaches.  
Scope: As nature positive actions gain momentum and biodiversity is increasingly integrated 
into policies, it is essential to ensure governance frameworks can support large -scale, 
coordinated implementation. Relevant stakeholders should be actively involved in shaping 
new solutions adapted to different and local contexts. 
Living labs have the potential to empower a green transition and a transformative change 
towards nature positive society and economy by developing solutions in a co -creative manner 
and involving actors in real life settings to achieve large -scale impact and foster collaboration 
between sectors and communities. 
Proposals should align with key policies including the European Green Deal and the EU 
biodiversity strategy for 2030, the Sustainable Development Goals, the Kunming -Montreal 
Global Biodiversity Framework (GBF), the Paris Agreement, the European Climate Law and 
the One Health approach. 
Proposals should: 
• establish living labs as real -world testing environments to experiment with policy 
solutions, stakeholder engagement, and new economic models, while strengthening 
collective capacities and well -being, and identifying and overcoming barriers that limit 
participation in living labs; 
• develop inclusive, intersectional and adaptive governance strategies that foster systemic 
transformative change, based on both biodiversity and socio -economic metrics and 
emphasising equity and sustainability.  
In particular, actions are expected to: 
• conduct a comprehensive review and analysis of policies related to both direct and 
indirect drivers of biodiversity loss, with the aim of identifying conflicting or competing 
objectives and informing more coherent, nature positive policy frameworks; 
• analyse the legal, financial and institutional barriers to inclusive governance in Europe, 
including the assessment of political and economic obstacles and of active strategies by 
actors and develop proposals to pilot and test innovative policy instruments, such as 
citizens’ assemblies, participatory budgeting and, if and when relevant, nature credits as 
proposed in the Nature Credits Roadmap124, to foster transformative change; 
• develop multi -level governance models and policy proposals to integrate all relevant 
nature positive actions (including protection and restoration of ecosystems, Nature-based 
Solutions, circular economy, sustainable bioeconomy, regenerative agriculture, 
agroecology, agroforestry, bioremediation, etc.) into all relevant EU policies and 
strategies in a synergetic and coherent way; 
• identify relevant existing EU funded communities of practices, such as the Nature -based 
Solutions hubs, the circular economy hubs and the adaptation hubs, and group them per 
ecosystem or societal challenge; 
• set-up living labs to co -develop enabling pathways for transformative change and test 
them to ensure positive impacts on the ground, drawing on best practices (including 
emerging nature positive actions), identifying knowledge gaps and addressing research 
and innovation needs in collaboration with all relevant stakeholders; 
• develop digital tools to synthesise and visualise diverse knowledge sources and create 
decision-support systems for inclusive governance, in view to inform all stakeholders 
about all existing nature positive actions per ecosystem or societal challenge and to 
propose the best options in terms of both biodiversity and socio -economic gains for a 
specific and/or local context (e.g. surface area, available budget, main challenge, specific 
regional area).  
Proposals should address Area A: living labs per ecosystem (marine, freshwater, terrestrial 
(including agriculture, forestry, cities)) or Area B: living labs per societal challenge (climate 
change, water, food, health, pollution, spatial planning). The area (A or B) should be clearly 
indicated on the application. 
Proposals should ensure close collaboration with the other project selected under this topic. 
They should also offer training for policymakers, community leaders, and researchers on co -
governance and knowledge integration and develop educational materials and ensure 
coordination and exchanges between all living labs. Proposals should adopt interdisciplinary 
approaches and ensure policymakers, business leaders and stakeholders co-create, experiment, 
and validate new solutions in an open, user-centred way. 
Solutions should be adapted to the environmental, socio -economic, and cultural contexts of 
each living lab, considering both cultural and natural heritage. Scaling and transferability 
challenges should be addressed through collaborative approaches combining scientific 
knowledge with local expertise. In this respect, particular attention could be paid to the 
 
specific characteristics of the outermost regions. The gender dimension should also be 
integrated. 
Proposals must implement the multi -actor approach, involving a range of stakeholders, 
including when relevant farmers, foresters and land managers, fishing and aquaculture 
communities, spatial planners and landscape architects, tourism actors, water governance 
bodies, business leaders, energy producers, local authorities, NGOs and youth organisations, 
to ensure that the knowledge and needs from various sectors are integrated and the results are 
impactful. 
Proposals should seek to address knowledge gaps identified by IPBES assessments and, if 
relevant, provide recommendations to policymakers. They should build on existing 
knowledge from and ensure complementarity with other relevant EU -funded projects under 
Horizon Europe Work Programmes 125, including Biodiversa+ and NetworkNaturePLUS, and 
foresee appropriate resources to ensure close cooperation with the EC Knowledge Centre for 
Biodiversity (KCBD) and its Science Service. 
This topic requires the effective contribution of SSH disciplines to collect and validate both 
technical and socio-economic data.
