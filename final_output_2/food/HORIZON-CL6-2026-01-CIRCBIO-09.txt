and biodiversity objectives to unlock sustainable value chains 
Call: Call 01 - single stage (2026) 
Specific conditions 
Expected EU 
contribution per 
project 
The Commission estimates that an EU contribution of around EUR 6.00 
million would allow these outcomes to be addressed appropriately. 
Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of a 
proposal requesting different amounts. 
Indicative budget The total indicative budget for the topic is EUR 12.00 million. 
Type of Action Research and Innovation Actions 
Eligibility 
conditions 
The conditions are described in General Annex B. The following 
exceptions apply: 
The following additional eligibility criteria apply: the proposals must 
apply the multi -actor approach. See definition of the multi -actor 
approach in this work programme part. 
Legal and financial 
set-up of the Grant 
Agreements 
The rules are described in General Annex G. The following exceptions 
apply: 
Eligible costs will take the form of a lump sum as defined in the 
Decision of 7 July 2021 authorising the use of lump sum contributions 
under the Horizon Europe Programme – the Framework Programme for 
Research and Innovation (2021 -2027) – and in actions under the 
Research and Training Programme of the European Atomic Energy 
Community (2021-2025) 241. 
 
Expected Outcome: Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected 
outcomes: 
• decision-makers have improved understanding of the impacts of bioeconomy and nature 
markets on the sustainability of the agricultural sector, food security, climate and 
biodiversity, as well as on land-use conflicts; 
• society benefits from economic activities that align bioeconomy, climate and 
biodiversity objectives while safeguarding food security; 
• farmers gain opportunities to diversify their production, their income and improve the 
environmental performance of agricultural production without compromising food 
supply; 
• policymakers are better equipped to develop more effective, evidence -based agricultural 
and environmental policies.  
Scope: As the bioeconomy and nature markets gain importance, enabling diversification of 
value streams for farmers, policymakers must ensure that the growing use of agricultural 
biomass and agricultural land for non -food purposes (e.g., for the development of novel bio -
based chemicals, compounds, materials, products and services, energy production, 
environmental services provision, carbon and biodiversity credits) does not compromise food 
security. For the purpose of this topic, nature markets encompass market mechanisms (e.g., 
nature credits as proposed in the Nature Credits Roadmap 242, carbon credits, market -based 
payments for environmental services) mobilising private finance to create income streams for 
primary producers in return for undertaking actions supporting well -functioning ecosystem 
services (e.g., water quality and availability, biodiversity, climate). Strategies are needed to 
balance market incentives, safeguard food supply and the environment, and support farmers in 
diversifying incomes through sustainable business models and value chains. Successful 
proposals should support the EU Vision for Agriculture and Food, the Common Agricultural 
Policy, the new EU bioeconomy strategy, the Carbon Removals and Carbon Farming (CRCF) 
Regulation and the climate and biodiversity objectives of the European Green Deal. 
Proposals should: 
• explore natural capital accounting methods integrating economics and nature into 
agricultural accounts, and their potential to support economic valuation, pricing and 
integration in decision-making of environmental services provided by farmers; 
• analyse existing and develop new innovative business models and value chains from 
which farmers can derive fair value and new income beyond food and feed production. 
This work should include, among others, an assessment of their potential to integrate 
sustainable practices, enhance farm profitability and performance, and support the 

transition to a circular bio -based economy and the green transition, as well as an 
assessment of the market operators involved; 
• when conducting the research/assessment, consider the potential of biomass residues and 
secondary biomass streams, including waste, as well as low value, unused or 
underutilised biomass, and land areas; 
• conduct interdisciplinary research from farm to macro levels, encompassing economic, 
social, biodiversity and climate impacts, and provide analytical tools in particular 
assessing implications for:        
 farmers' income, decision -making and farm management including of its natural 
capital;    
 biomass supply and demand and threshold effects of market prices on production 
choices;    
 land-use conflicts and food security risks (covering the availability, accessibility, 
utilisation and stability dimensions), considering leakage effects and other potential 
conflicts of use (e.g. water);   
• provide recommendations for the design of policies and sustainable business models and 
value chains. The recommendations should anticipate trade -offs and align bioeconomy, 
climate and biodiversity goals while safeguarding food security and ensuring that 
farmers can diversify and receive fair incomes. They should also respond to evolving 
consumer demand.  
Proposals should ensure complementarities with ongoing relevant Horizon Europe projects 
and capitalise on existing relevant research findings and tools. Proposals should also ensure 
synergies with other relevant EU -funded LIFE and knowledge innovation projects, studies, 
pilot projects, initiatives and processes (e.g., Economic Accounts for Agriculture framework). 
Proposals should include a dedicated task, appropriate resources and a plan on how they will 
collaborate with other projects selected under this topic (e.g., by participating in joint 
activities, workshops, as well as common communication and dissemination activities). 
Proposals must implement the multi -actor approach, with a consortium based on a balanced 
mix of actors with complementary knowledge, including farmers, researchers, farm 
accountants, and businesses. 
This topic should involve the effective contribution of Social Sciences and Humanities (SSH) 
disciplines. 
Proposals are encouraged to consider, where relevant, the data, expertise and services offered 
by European research infrastructures243 in the environment, biological & food domains.
