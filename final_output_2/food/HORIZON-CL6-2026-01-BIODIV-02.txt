HORIZON-CL6-2026-01-BIODIV-02: Developing methods to assess the presence, 
functions and sensitivity of groundwater ecosystems 
Call: Call 01 - single stage (2026) 
Specific conditions 
Expected EU 
contribution per 
project 
The Commission estimates that an EU contribution of around EUR 5.00 
million would allow these outcomes to be addressed appropriately. 
Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of a 
proposal requesting different amounts. 
Indicative budget The total indicative budget for the topic is EUR 10.00 million. 
Type of Action Research and Innovation Actions 
Eligibility 
conditions 
The conditions are described in General Annex B. The following 
exceptions apply: 
The Joint Research Centre (JRC) may participate as member of the 
consortium selected for funding as a beneficiary with zero funding, or as 
an associated partner. The JRC will not participate in the preparation and 
submission of the proposal - see General Annex B. 
 
Expected Outcome:   
Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes: 
 
• the knowledge of existing groundwater ecosystems 90  is improved, supporting 
policymakers and technical experts in assessments of their presence, functions and 
condition or status, and their role for climate change mitigation; 
• society benefits from enhanced knowledge and awareness of pollution and 
overexploitation risks to groundwater ecosystems and the ecosystem services provided 
by them, including of possible implications for other related ecosystems (associated 
aquatic and dependent terrestrial ecosystems) and for human health as well as for food 
and water security, disaster risk reduction and resilience building; 
• the EU water polices are supported with new scientific evidence and public authorities 
are better equipped for setting effective measures for the protection of groundwater 
biodiversity and their possible links to groundwater-dependent ecosystems.  
Scope: The European Environment Agency (EEA)’s report on Europe's state of water 
(2024)91 highlighted that 77% of groundwater, which supplies two thirds of the EU's drinking 
water, is in good chemical status. For groundwater not reaching good chemical status, the 
report identified nitrates, pesticides and pharmaceuticals among main issues. However, less is 
known about contaminants of emerging concern, such as perfluorinated substances (e.g. 
PFAS), microplastics and antimicrobial resistance. The Commission proposal 92 to revise the 
lists of surface - and groundwater pollutants and their standards in the Water Framework 
Directive, in the Groundwater Directive and in the Environmental Quality Standards Directive 
aims to address these concerns. Although freshwater standards can serve as a benchmark, 
standards that are protective for freshwater ecosystems may not be sufficiently protective for 
groundwater ecosystems.93 Much stronger evidence on presence, functions and sensitivity of 
groundwater ecosystems is required for a reliable hazard assessment. 
Significant knowledge gaps exist regarding groundwater ecosystems and their biodiversity in 
Europe, making it challenging to establish their effective protection. Proposals should address 
such gaps, which would ultimately lead to better protection of our precious drinking water 
resources, as well as groundwater biodiversity and geodiversity, but also groundwater (aquatic 
and terrestrial)-dependent ecosystems and biodiversity. 
More specifically proposals under this topic should include all of the following activities: 
• improve and develop innovative methods, including by utilising sensors (e.g. biosensors, 
remote sensors), for assessing and characterising groundwater ecosystems and their 
 
sensitivity, and identifying the presence and functions of different taxonomic groups and 
organisms; 
• establish harmonised, validated, and ultimately standardised, methods and generate 
reliable experimental data on acute and chronic effects for assessing ecotoxicity of 
pollutants as regards groundwater ecosystems and in particular sensitive/ vulnerable 
ecosystems, with the aim to prioritize substances and deriving groundwater standards to 
protect them; 
• identify a suite of biological and physico-chemical quality elements in view of a possible 
future assessment and classification of groundwater ecological status for inclusion in EU 
water legislation. This should include developing criteria and targets related to the 
temporary or long-term impacts on groundwater ecosystems.   
Where relevant, activities should build and expand on the results of past and ongoing EU -
funded projects and initiatives, for example projects funded by the co -funded partnership 
“Water4All”, with focus on groundwaters, to share experiences, reach synergies and avoid 
duplication. 
Proposals are encouraged to combine inter -disciplinary expertise and integrate perspectives 
from different governance levels. 
Concrete efforts should be made to ensure that the data produced in the context of the funded 
project is FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Re -usable), exploring workflows 
that can provide “FAIR -by-design” data, i.e., data that is FAIR from its generation. 
Possibilities offered by the European Open Science Cloud (EOSC) and by relevant European 
research infrastructures including the Catalogue of Life (COL), DiSSCo, LifeWatch ERIC, 
eLTER and MIRRI -ERIC (and any other relevant research infrastructure prioritised by the 
European Strategy Forum on Research Infrastructures (ESFRI) 94) to store and give access to 
research data could be considered where relevant. 
Proposals should foresee appropriate resources to ensure close cooperation with the EC 
Knowledge Centre for Biodiversity (KCBD) and its Science Service. The research actions are 
expected to yield valuable new insights and data, supporting and informing future assessments 
by IPBES. 
The JRC can provide estimates of groundwater recharge and contribution of groundwater to 
streamflow, based on continental scale hydrological modelling, and consider testing the 
methods developed in the project, for the purposes of continental scale assessment of 
groundwater-dependent ecosystems.  
International cooperation with Mediterranean countries is encouraged.
