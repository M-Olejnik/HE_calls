HORIZON-CL6-2026-02-FARM2FORK-10: Sustainable and healthy diets based on 
health status and socio-economic risk factors of ageing population 
Call: Call 02 - single stage (2026) 
Specific conditions 
Expected EU 
contribution per 
The Commission estimates that an EU contribution of around EUR 2.00 
million would allow these outcomes to be addressed appropriately. 
project Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of a 
proposal requesting different amounts. 
Indicative budget The total indicative budget for the topic is EUR 2.00 million. 
Type of Action Coordination and Support Actions 
Legal and financial 
set-up of the Grant 
Agreements 
The rules are described in General Annex G. The following exceptions 
apply: 
Eligible costs will take the form of a lump sum as defined in the 
Decision of 7 July 2021 authorising the use of lump sum contributions 
under the Horizon Europe Programme – the Framework Programme for 
Research and Innovation (2021 -2027) – and in actions under the 
Research and Training Programme of the European Atomic Energy 
Community (2021-2025) 164. 
 
Expected Outcome: Project results are expected to contribute to all the following expected 
outcomes: 
• improved identification of specific dietary needs (including foods, beverages, food 
ingredients and nutrients) for the older population (above 65 years old) with a positive 
impact on their health, wellbeing, and prevention of any diseases (including those related 
to ageing); 
• better understanding of sustainable food production and processing, and of the social and 
economic impact of healthy diets on disease prevention among the older population; 
• improved knowledge in Member States and Associated Countries on how to develop at 
national, regional and local level the diet provided to the older population, in particular 
to those living in home cares or other structures hosting them as well as to people living 
alone; 
• improved identification of innovative easy-to-chew food products enriched with specific 
nutrients and bioactive natural compounds, that can be included into the diet of the older 
population.  
Scope: The topic is relevant to the EU policies related to ageing such as the Green Paper on 
Ageing adopted on 27 January 2021 165, the Commission Communication on Demographic 
 
change in Europe: a toolbox for action 166, Principle 18 of the European Pillar of Social rights 
on long-term care and the R&I Food 2030 framework. 
Proposals should address all the following activities: 
• map data on the older population in Europe based on their gender, frailty, social 
(loneliness, disabilities, etc) and economic vulnerabilities (low income, etc); 
• develop and provide to Member States and Associated Countries a healthy and 
affordable diet programme (e.g. guidance, recommendation, etc) for the older population 
(including those in care homes) affected by malnutrition or at a high risk to develop 
malnutrition; 
• develop and provide to Member States and Associated Countries nutrient and tailored 
food dietary recommendations to be used in home care and other national, regional and 
local institutions or infrastructures responsible for the care of older people as well as for 
older people living alone; 
• develop and provide prevention campaigns and post -recovery programmes for the older 
population affected by any disease due to unhealthy diets; 
• develop and provide campaigns which consider the sustainability of food categories 
produced and processed with impact on the health of older population.  
Proposals should involve the effective contribution of SSH disciplines. The support of experts 
in economic and psychological disciplines for older population is relevant for the scope of the 
proposals. 
Proposals should consider as far as relevant the results achieved under the FP7 projects: “New 
dietary strategies addressing the specific needs of elderly population for a healthy ageing in 
Europe”167 and “Optimised food products for elderly populations”168.
