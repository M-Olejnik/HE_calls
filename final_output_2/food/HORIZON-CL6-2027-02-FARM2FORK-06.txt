HORIZON-CL6-2027-02-FARM2FORK-06: Unleashing the potential of sustainable 
small-scale aquatic food production and recreational fisheries for prosperous local 
communities 
Call: Call 02 - single stage (2027) 
Specific conditions 
Expected EU 
contribution per 
project 
The Commission estimates that an EU contribution of around EUR 5.00 
million would allow these outcomes to be addressed appropriately. 
Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of a 
proposal requesting different amounts. 
Indicative budget The total indicative budget for the topic is EUR 10.00 million. 
Type of Action Innovation Actions 
Technology 
Readiness Level 
Activities are expected to achieve TRL 6 -7 by the end of the project – 
see General Annex B. Activities may start at any TRL. 
Legal and financial 
set-up of the Grant 
Agreements 
The rules are described in General Annex G. The following exceptions 
apply: 
Eligible costs will take the form of a lump sum as defined in the 
Decision of 7 July 2021 authorising the use of lump sum contributions 
under the Horizon Europe Programme – the Framework Programme for 
Research and Innovation (2021 -2027) – and in actions under the 
Research and Training Programme of the European Atomic Energy 
Community (2021-2025) 205. 
 
Expected Outcome : In line with the EU Common Fisheries Policy and the revised EU 
Fisheries Control Regulation, the European Ocean Pact, the Vision for Fisheries and 
Aquaculture with a 2040 perspective, the strategic guidelines for sustainable and competitive 
aquaculture, the EU algae initiative, Farm to Fork Strategy, the EU biodiversity strategy for 
2030 and the Food 2030 policy framework, project results are expected to contribute to all of 
the following expected outcomes: 
• economic prosperity is fostered in coastal, rural and urban communities through 
improved business models, value chain integration and market access for small scale 
producers that can contribute offering attractive jobs; 
 
• consumers benefit from the availability of locally produced, nutritious, and safe aquatic 
food following high environmental and social standards; 
• more resilient and empowered communities at local and regional levels by fostering 
innovation in aquatic food value chain and addressing challenges such as climate 
change, biodiversity loss, and resource management; 
• a more competitive and sustainable aquatic food sector by advancing ecosystem -based 
management practices, digitalization and technological innovation based on the latest 
scientific research.  
Scope: Small-scale aquatic food production includes small -scale fisheries, recreational 
fisheries and aquaculture farms that are classified as SMEs. In 2021, small -scale fisheries 
contributed to 49% of employment in EU fisheries. Together with other maritime activities, 
small-scale fisheries play a vital role in local economies, particularly in the Mediterranean, 
where over half of the sector is concentrated. Recreational fisheries are non -commercial 
fishing activities exploiting marine biological resources for recreation, tourism or sport. While 
the marketing or sale of catches from recreational fisheries is prohibited, if properly 
monitored and managed they can contribute to conservation efforts and support community 
development. According to the Scientific, Technical and Economic Committee for Fisheries, 
the aquaculture sector in the EU consists primarily of small and family -owned enterprises- 
especially in the case of mollusk farms. However, small -scale actors often face difficulties in 
developing and adopting innovative technologies. 
Selected proposals should advance knowledge and develop tools, including Nature -based 
Solutions, for managing and further developing small -scale aquatic food production. They 
should include, where relevant, both aspects of natural science and technical know -how to 
improve small-scale aquatic food production as well as issues related to social sciences and 
humanities (SSH) disciplines, to produce meaningful and significant effects enhancing the 
societal impact of the related innovation activities. In the frame of SSH, cultural elements 
such as local traditions related to aquatic food production and consumption could be included. 
The scope of the topic includes fisheries and aquaculture activities taking place in fresh, 
brackish and marine waters, such as small -scale fisheries, small -scale mollusk, seaweed and 
fish farms, recreational fisheries, urban aquaculture and aquaponics. 
Selected proposals should develop innovative methodologies to assess environmental and 
socio-economic contributions of relevant small -scale actors to the prosperity of local 
communities within the broader aquatic food system, taking into account a gender sensitive 
approach and the specific needs of groups in vulnerable situations. This could, for example, 
include diverse data sources (e.g. citizen science, social media) and advance data processing, 
validation, and interoperability solutions using for example AI, machine learning, and big data 
analytics to provide actionable insights. 
The effects of climate change on small -scale aquatic food production should be addressed as 
well as the potential contribution of small -scale aquatic food production to climate change 
mitigation and adaptation. Additionally, the potential for environmental services provision 
and of improvements of ecological footprint should be explored. Aquatic animal welfare 
issues should be considered, where relevant. 
Selected proposals should include from their design throughout their development and 
implementation relevant stakeholders and end -users and produce outputs that can be readily 
applicable by them. Special attention should be given to knowledge transfer, training, and 
capacity-building activities to ensure the practical implementation of research findings and 
innovations by small-scale actors and policymakers.
