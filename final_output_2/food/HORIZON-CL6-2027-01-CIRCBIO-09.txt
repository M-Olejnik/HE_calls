HORIZON-CL6-2027-01-CIRCBIO-09: Increasing the circularity of bio -based sector: 
upcycling and recycling for higher value and environmental benefits 
Call: Call 01 - single stage (2027) 
Specific conditions 
Expected EU 
contribution per 
project 
The Commission estimates that an EU contribution of around EUR 6.00 
million would allow these outcomes to be addressed appropriately. 
Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of a 
proposal requesting different amounts. 
Indicative budget The total indicative budget for the topic is EUR 12.00 million. 
Type of Action Innovation Actions 
Technology 
Readiness Level 
Activities are expected to achieve TRL 6 -7 by the end of the project – 
see General Annex B. Activities may start at any TRL. 
Legal and financial The rules are described in General Annex G. The following exceptions 
set-up of the Grant 
Agreements 
apply: 
The granting authority may, up to 4 years after the end of the action, 
object to a transfer of ownership or to the exclusive licensing of results, 
as set out in the specific provision of Annex 5. 
Eligible costs will take the form of a lump sum as defined in the 
Decision of 7 July 2021 authorising the use of lump sum contributions 
under the Horizon Europe Programme – the Framework Programme for 
Research and Innovation (2021 -2027) – and in actions under the 
Research and Training Programme of the European Atomic Energy 
Community (2021-2025) 268. 
 
Expected Outcome: Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected 
outcomes: 
• European industry’s competitiveness, decarbonisation, and strategic autonomy are 
enhanced through the development and deployment of safe, sustainable, circular and bio-
based value chains; 
• improved climate change adaptation and mitigation and overall environmental 
sustainability, as well as higher resource efficiency, through application of 
biotechnologies and industrial symbiosis, and recovery of biological materials, water and 
energy.  
Scope: The projects under this topic are relevant to the EU policies related to the Commission 
communication on: Building the future with nature: Boosting Biotechnology and 
Biomanufacturing in the EU, the Life Sciences Strategy, the EU Biotech Act, Clean Industrial 
Deal and the SME Strategy. It also contributes to the Start -ups and Scale -ups strategy. 
Synergies with activities under the Circular Bio-based Europe (CBE) Joint Undertaking269 and 
New European Bauhaus are strongly encouraged, while taking care to avoid overlaps. 
Proposals should address the following activities: 
• develop and deploy/scale -up safe and sustainable, circular and bio -based materials, 
products, processes and value chains, e.g. including but not limited to the construction, 
packaging, pulp and paper, textile sectors, or other bio -based consumer products, using 
upcycled and recycled resources incorporating secondary raw materials with minimal 
quality loss, aiming at best environmental performance, while increasing the uptake of 
recycled materials and preventing waste through repair, refurbishment, and reuse, and 
paying attention to environmental and health risks and trade -offs due to treated or 
 
impregnated bio -based materials, where relevant. Bioenergy/biofuels sector is not in 
scope, but synergies with this sector can be considered while respecting the cascading 
biomass valorisation principle and aiming at the industrial symbiosis; 
• develop innovative new, or upgraded existing, circular solutions to tackle complex bio -
waste streams and create markets for bio -waste materials by transforming them into 
valuable secondary resources, while fostering urban/rural/coastal industrial symbiosis, 
providing data and digital tools and promoting a more efficient use of bio -based 
resources; 
• develop a ‘digital marketplace’, ensuring convergence with the digital technology, tools 
and applications, to enhance accessibility and traceability of bio -based resources, 
promoting efficient and sustainable resource management; 
• provide recommendations for the development of bio -based product value chains, based 
on the identified and analysed needs of stakeholders in terms of national and European 
regulations and standards, financial incentives, professional trainings, etc.  
While the main focus of this topic is not the gaseous carbon conversion (see parallel topic 
HORIZON-CL6-2027-01-CIRCBIO-08: Biotechnology application for CCU), this 
technology can be considered as part of the whole value chain approach to increase 
environmental and economic impact, e.g. as part of the cascading biomass conversion, taking 
care to avoid overlaps and seek synergies. Synergy and cooperation with the parallel topics 
HORIZON-CL6-2027-01-CIRCBIO-02: Enhancing ecodesign and circularity of construction 
products and HORIZON-MISS-2027-03-OCEAN-02: Circularity of seafood supply chain are 
strongly encouraged. 
Proposals are encouraged to build on the knowledge and results of completed and ongoing 
EU-funded projects. Cooperation between all proposals funded under this topic should also be 
foreseen, as a specific task, with an allocation of resources, for synergies. 
This topic requires the effective contribution of SSH disciplines and involvement of SSH 
experts in order to produce meaningful and significant effects enhancing the societal impact 
of the related research activities. This can cover the educational aspect, to facilitate 
knowledge promotion within different target groups (e.g. students, industry, society). 
International cooperation is encouraged.
