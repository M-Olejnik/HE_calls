Specific conditions 
Expected EU

The Commission estimates that an EU contribution of around EUR 6.00 
million would allow these outcomes to be addressed appropriately. 
Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of a 
proposal requesting different amounts. 
Indicative budget The total indicative budget for the topic is EUR 12.00 million. 
Type of Action Innovation Actions 
Eligibility 
conditions 
The conditions are described in General Annex B. The following 
exceptions apply: 
The following additional eligibility criteria apply: the proposals must 
apply the multi -actor approach. See definition of the multi -actor 
approach in this work programme part. 
The Joint Research Centre (JRC) may participate as member of the 
consortium selected for funding as a beneficiary with zero funding, or 
as an associated partner. The JRC will not participate in the preparation 
and submission of the proposal - see General Annex B. 
Technology 
Readiness Level 
Activities are expected to achieve TRL 7 by the end of the project – see 
General Annex B. Activities may start at any TRL.  
Legal and financial 
set-up of the Grant 
Agreements 
The rules are described in General Annex G. The following exceptions 
apply: 
Eligible costs will take the form of a lump sum as defined in the 
Decision of 7 July 2021 authorising the use of lump sum contributions 
under the Horizon Europe Programme – the Framework Programme for 
Research and Innovation (2021 -2027) – and in actions under the 
Research and Training Programme of the European Atomic Energy 
Community (2021-2025) 193. 
 
Expected Outcome: Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected 
outcomes: 
 
• farmers experience increasing benefits from the adoption of safe, efficient, practical and 
affordable improved or novel feed additives and related practices that reduce GHG and 
air pollutants emissions, minimize environmental impact and have neither adverse 
effects on animal productivity nor on animal welfare; 
• Farmer and agricultural advisors gain improved access to knowledge, resources and 
distribution channels for feed additives, that favour the integration of these solutions into 
common practices; 
• evidence-based recommendations are provided for the implementation of EU policies 
and strategies, including the CAP, relevant to sustainable livestock farming systems, 
while also serving as a resource for regulatory authorities.  
Scope: The projects under this topic are relevant to the EU policies related to the EU Green 
Deal objectives for resilient and sustainable agri -food systems, the EU climate policy, the 
methane strategy, the Vision for Agriculture and Food, and the EU Action Plan for the 
Development of Organic Production194. 
Livestock production significantly contributes to GHG emissions and resource consumption, 
making it essential to improve feed efficiency and reduce environmental impact. Enteric 
fermentation in ruminants produces substantial methane emissions, while inefficient feed 
conversion increases feed demand, land use, and pollution. Developing and implementing 
effective feed additives can lower methane production, enhance nutrient utilization, and 
reduce nitrogen excretion, supporting sustainable livestock farming, improved profitability for 
farmers, and global climate goals. 
Reducing methane emissions from ruminants contributes to environmental sustainability by 
lowering the climate and environmental impact of livestock production, while also supporting 
economic sustainability for farmers through improved productivity and cost savings. Only a 
handful of additives have demonstrated significant effectiveness in reducing methane 
emissions or have become commercially available. The limited availability of reliable options 
and the challenges posed by inconsistent efficacy and applicability across diverse production 
systems represent a constraint. Proposals should address various terrestrial livestock systems, 
from conventional to extensive systems, considering regional feeding systems. Proposals 
should address at least farmed large ruminants. 
Proposals should address all the following activities: 
• develop and test a wide range of additives that reduce emissions in operational 
environment (reaching TRL 7), their synergies and optimal delivery strategies for 
diverse terrestrial livestock systems, including extensive and grass -based systems, both 
under conventional and organic production. Impacts on animal health, welfare, 
performance, product quality, and net GHG emissions and air pollutants, and potential 
trade-offs among these factors should be addressed; 
 
• identify clear endpoints for risk assessment of feed additives to demonstrate their safety 
and define complementarity criteria to demonstrate their effectiveness and 
environmental impact, all supported by scientific evidence; 
• verify the practicalities, applicability, scalability and socio -economic-environmental 
impacts, including trade -offs with other environmental and social dimensions, of using 
feed additives across different production systems and in different feeding scenarios; 
• promote and facilitate a standardised data collection system for quality control 
procedures and record -keeping practices that ensures consistency across stakeholder 
groups and meets the requirements for accurate reporting, keeping in mind the EU 195 and 
EFSA regulatory framework from the inception and for feed additives; 
• identify strategies like improved distribution networks, farmer education programmes, 
and possible subsidies or incentives to make new innovative feed additives that reduce 
livestock emissions more affordable; 
• assessing consumer perception to understand attitudes towards the use of feed additives 
to reduce emissions in livestock production and identify key factors influencing their 
decisions.  
The JRC participation could involve contributing to scenario assessment with the integrated 
agro-economic modelling platform (iMAP), sharing information, and contributing to 
dissemination of results. 
To respect the ‘Do -No-Significant-Harm' (DNSH) principle, proposals need to properly 
address and exclude any potential risk of feed additives on the environment, animal or human 
health. 
Proposals must implement the multi -actor approach and ensure adequate involvement of the 
main stakeholders involved in the livestock sectors, including farmers, advisors, private 
sector/industry (e.g., processors, feed manufacturers), policy-makers, consumers, etc. 
Proposals should capitalise on research findings and tools, included those developed under 
previous and ongoing relevant research projects. Proposals should interact with relevant 
structures or organizations at European level and beyond such as FAO, Livestock 
Environmental Assessment and Performance Partnership (LEAP, FAO) 196, Global Research 
Alliance on Agricultural Greenhouse Gases197. 
To better address the requirements of the topic, international cooperation is encouraged.
