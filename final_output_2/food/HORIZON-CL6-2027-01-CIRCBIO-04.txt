HORIZON-CL6-2027-01-CIRCBIO-04: Capacity building for extending product 
lifecycles through repair and refurbishment 
Call: Call 01 - single stage (2027) 
Specific conditions 
Expected EU 
contribution per 
project 
The Commission estimates that an EU contribution of between EUR 
4.00 and 5.00 million would allow these outcomes to be addressed 
appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and 
selection of a proposal requesting different amounts. 
Indicative budget The total indicative budget for the topic is EUR 9.00 million. 
Type of Action Research and Innovation Actions 
Legal and financial 
set-up of the Grant 
Agreements 
The rules are described in General Annex G. The following exceptions 
apply: 
Eligible costs will take the form of a lump sum as defined in the 
Decision of 7 July 2021 authorising the use of lump sum contributions 
under the Horizon Europe Programme – the Framework Programme for 
Research and Innovation (2021 -2027) – and in actions under the 
Research and Training Programme of the European Atomic Energy 
Community (2021-2025) 260. 
 
Expected Outcome: Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected 
outcomes: 
• professionals, consumers and educators adopt innovative repair and refurbishment 
practices in specific product value chains (electronics, furniture, textiles and footwear), 
enabling significant reductions in waste, environmental impacts and biodiversity loss, 
while driving cost savings and job creation in the repair and refurbishment sector; 
 
• professionals, consumers, local partners, social economy actors and educators have 
access to high -quality training programs that provide them with technical, business and 
social skills to repair and refurbish products, thus promoting sustainable consumption 
and production patterns, climate change adaptation and mitigation, reduction of waste 
and emissions and enhancing resilience of product value chains.  
Scope: As the EU strives to reduce waste and promote sustainable consumption, as outlined in 
the European Green Deal, the Clean Industrial Deal and the upcoming Circular Economy Act, 
extending product lifecycles through repair and refurbishment practices has become a key 
approach for achieving a circular economy and extending products’ lifecycles. To support this 
transition, there is a growing need for innovative capacity -building initiatives that equip 
professionals, consumers, local authorities and educators with the skills and knowledge 
required to repair and refurbish products. These practices can contribute to the extension of 
product lifecycles, thus reducing environmental and climate impacts and contributing for the 
development of a single market for sustainable products. 
Proposals should: 
• develop and test innovative, modular and scalable training programs for professionals, 
consumers, local partners, social economy actors and educators, focusing on the repair 
and refurbishment of one or more of the following product categories: electronics 
(including household appliances), furniture, textiles and footwear. These training 
programs should create engaging, accessible and effective learning experiences that 
support the development of repair and refurbishment skills; 
• develop and test new services for repair and refurbishment, as well as strategies for their 
uptake, considering the potential to reduce biodiversity impacts, support climate change 
adaptation and mitigation, and promote sustainable consumption patterns. The focus 
should be on making them accessible and affordable to all consumers, including those 
with disabilities or with limited access, financial resources or technical expertise. To 
achieve this, the strategies should investigate various approaches: such as affordable, 
accessible and convenient repair services, community -based repair initiatives, and 
knowledge and expertise sharing mechanisms and digital platforms; 
• evaluate the feasibility, effectiveness and impact of these new services and strategies 
using robust evaluation methods (including lifecycle assessments such as Product 
Environmental Footprint, where relevant) and present data and evidence about the 
economic, environmental and social costs and benefits of the developed strategies.  
The topic supports EU policies, particularly the European Green Deal, the Ecodesign for 
Sustainable Products Regulation, the upcoming Circular Economy Act and Europe’s efforts to 
develop a single market for sustainable products. 
This topic requires the effective contribution of SSH disciplines and the involvement of SSH 
experts, institutions as well as the inclusion of relevant SSH expertise, in order to produce 
meaningful and significant effects enhancing the societal impact of the related research 
activities.
