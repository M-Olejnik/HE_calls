Antarctica and the Southern Ocean 
Call: Call 02 - single stage (2027) 
Specific conditions 
Expected EU 
contribution per 
project 
The Commission estimates that an EU contribution of around EUR 11.00 
million would allow these outcomes to be addressed appropriately. 
Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of a 
proposal requesting different amounts. 
Indicative budget The total indicative budget for the topic is EUR 22.00 million. 
Type of Action Research and Innovation Actions 
Eligibility 
conditions 
The conditions are described in General Annex B. The following 
exceptions apply: 
All international organisations are exceptionally eligible for funding. 
If projects use satellite -based earth observation, positioning, navigation 
and/or related timing data and services, beneficiaries must make use of 
Copernicus and/or Galileo/EGNOS (other data and services may 
additionally be used). 
 
Expected Outcome: Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected 
outcomes: 
• improved multidisciplinary scientific understanding of the functioning of the Southern 
Ocean and the Antarctic cryosphere and associated ecosystem dynamics, in the near term 
(∼2030), mid -term (2050 –2060) and long -term (after ∼2060), including their mutual 
interaction with, impact on and vulnerability to, current and future changes in the other 
components of the regional and global climate systems; 
• important contributions made to key ocean, cryosphere, climate and biodiversity 
monitoring indicators that support international, regional and global assessments. 
Fostered development of a regional approach to polar ocean, climate and biodiversity 
observations, monitoring and reporting; 
• informed policies for environmental conservation and climate resilience and enabled 
evidence-based regional, European, and global decision –making on polar ocean 
governance; sustained European leadership in ocean –climate–biodiversity-cryosphere 
science; significant contributions made to global scientific assessments (e.g. IPCC, 
IPBES and WOA), as well as to the UN Decades of Action of Ocean (2021 -2030) and 
Cryospheric (2025-2034) Sciences, the Antarctica InSync programme (2027 and 2030), 
the International Polar Year (2032 -2033), UN SDGs 13 and 14, and the European polar 
science coordination efforts.  
Scope: Proposals should: 
• resolve uncertainties, improve projections and quantifications of the future of the region, 
looking at changes in the near -, mid- and long-term (irreversible, abrupt and committed 
changes), their likelihood, timing, rate, amplitude, and impacts on the Earth’s System 
(decadal to millennial climate projections, global sea level, ocean circulation, global 
carbon budget); 
• advance understanding of the complex interactions and feedbacks between the ocean, the 
atmosphere, sea ice, ice shelves, and land ice dynamics, considering multiple scales and 
processes simultaneously, with focus on the Antarctic continental shelves where 
conditions are or will change rapidly and on regions for bottom water formation; 
• advance the knowledge of Southern Ocean dynamics and sea ice dynamics in the near -, 
mid- and long -term. Better understand the distribution, underlying mechanisms and 
impacts of changes in the Southern Ocean and sea ice to reduce uncertainties in 
projected future changes of large-scale ocean circulation and transport, including abrupt, 
irreversible change/tipping elements and thresholds, collapse of the overturning 
circulations, regional and global climate and weather systems. This should include 
extreme events and mid-latitude weather; fluxes between the ice sheet and the ocean; the 
• explore the vulnerability of Southern Ocean ecosystems, including the impacts of 
climate change, pollution and other anthropogenic activities on marine biodiversity and 
ecosystem dynamics changes in the near (∼2030), mid (2050–2060) and long-term (after 
∼2060). This includes improved control variables for the diversity of all life forms 
incorporating also the microbiome and functions (functional diversity), as well as the 
biocomplexity suitable for measuring biosphere integrity in different facets. Proposals 
should also contribute to the development or strengthening of long -term, continuous 
monitoring systems for Southern Ocean biodiversity and ecosystem functioning, in 
synergy with existing observation infrastructures; 
• develop mechanisms to distinguish human -induced environmental changes from natural 
ones and develop strategies to protect the fragile environment of the Southern Ocean 
from human activities and climate change, as well as comprehensively establish the 
efficacy of Southern Ocean conservation measures for preserving evolutionary potential 
and those properties that best anticipate change; 
• further improve key ocean, cryosphere, climate and biodiversity monitoring indicators 
that support international, regional and global assessments and foster the development of 
a regional approach to polar ocean and climate observations, monitoring and reporting, 
and further the representation of multi -scale interactions in Earth System Models 
(ESMs) and regional coupled atmosphere –ocean–sea ice–land models representing key 
physical, biogeochemical, and biological processes in the polar ocean regions; 
• advance capabilities to provide evidence, tractable proposals and recommendations for 
commensurate policy and protection, restoration and long -term sustainable management 
responses to prevent the Southern Ocean and its ecosystems and cryosphere from 
reaching a point of no return.  
The actions should contribute to the evolution of the EU Digital Twin of the Ocean and 
Destination Earth, and interface with the Southern Ocean Observing System (SOOS). All in -
situ data collected through actions funded from this topic should follow INSPIRE principles 
and be available through open access repositories supported by the European Commission 
(Copernicus, and EMODnet). Concrete efforts should be made to ensure that the data 
produced in the context of the funded projects is FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable 
and Re-usable). Proposals are encouraged to consider, where relevant, the data, expertise and 
services offered by European research infrastructures 313, as well as related projects in the 
environment domain, such as POLARIN 314. International cooperation is strongly encouraged, 
especially with All -Atlantic Ocean Research and Innovation Alliance (AAORIA) partner 
countries315. This topic is part of a coordination initiative between ESA and the European 
Commission on Earth System Science and should towards this end include sufficient means 
and resources for effective coordination, with relevant ESA Polar Science Cluster projects, 
 
including utilising novel satellite Earth Observation datasets and joint research actions. 
Furthermore, this topic is supporting the European polar science coordination efforts, 
including synergies with and support to the objectives and work plan of the European Polar 
Coordination Office (EPCO).
