HORIZON-CL6-2026-02-CLIMATE-01: Towards more effective, fair and coherent 
policies for climate change mitigation and adaptation in agriculture and forestry 
Call: Call 02 - single stage (2026) 
Specific conditions 
Expected EU 
contribution per 
project 
The Commission estimates that an EU contribution of around EUR 6.00 
million would allow these outcomes to be addressed appropriately. 
Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of a 
proposal requesting different amounts. 
Indicative budget The total indicative budget for the topic is EUR 6.00 million. 
Type of Action Research and Innovation Actions 
Legal and financial 
set-up of the Grant 
Agreements 
The rules are described in General Annex G. The following exceptions 
apply: 
Eligible costs will take the form of a lump sum as defined in the 
Decision of 7 July 2021 authorising the use of lump sum contributions 
under the Horizon Europe Programme – the Framework Programme for 
Research and Innovation (2021 -2027) – and in actions under the 
Research and Training Programme of the European Atomic Energy 
Community (2021-2025) 301. 
 
Expected Outcome: Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected 
outcomes: 
• decision-makers and stakeholders in the EU and in Associated Countries have access to 
comprehensive information and analyses on policy tools applied in the EU, in 
Associated Countries or in other jurisdictions whose experience can enrich the analysis, 
and which are targeting or otherwise affecting climate -change mitigation and adaptation 
outcomes in agriculture and in forestry; 
• decision-makers and stakeholders in the EU and in Associated Countries have access to 
evidence on the trade -offs and synergies between the application of policy tools 
regarding climate change mitigation and adaptation and their impact on economic, social 
and environmental outcomes, including those that do not harm or benefit biodiversity; 
• mutual learning takes place within and across science, policy and society on the 
characteristics and outcomes of different climate policy strategies affecting agriculture 
and forestry, the conditions of their effectiveness, and about synergies and trade -offs 
with other relevant sectoral and horizontal policies.  
Scope: Agriculture and forestry are among the sectors most directly impacted by climate 
change, while also playing important roles in its mitigation, through greenhouse gas 
emissions, their reduction and carbon removals from the atmosphere. These roles are 
addressed in horizontal EU climate policies such as the Regulations on Land Use, Land Use 
Change and Forestry (LULUCF) 302  and on Effort -sharing 303  or the forthcoming Climate 
Adaptation Plan, as well as in sectoral policies, most notably the Common Agricultural Policy 
(CAP) with a host of relevant rules and voluntary measures. The climate performance in 
agriculture and forestry is indirectly also affected by many other policies and measures, be 
they sectoral (e.g., on market organisation or on income support) or horizontal (e.g., on 
competitiveness). Depending on their design and application, climate policies in turn also 
have impacts beyond their immediate objectives, e.g. on competitiveness, income distribution, 
and biodiversity and nature protection. Apart from policies applicable in the EU and its 
Member States and in Associated Countries, the outcomes in each of these jurisdictions are 
also impacted by rules and standards applied in other parts of the world, through international 
markets and other transboundary effects. 
While efforts are made in some contexts to expand the scope of regular policy evaluations, so 
that they also include “external factors” and unintended consequences, this poses significant 
 
challenges methodologically and in terms of data and thus often remains an afterthought in 
analyses focused on individual policies or sectors. There is a need for more aggregate 
consideration of the full spectrum of levers impacting on climate outcomes, in a comparative 
and systemic perspective, with a view to improving the overall effectiveness, fairness and 
coherence of public policies. 
Proposals should: 
• making use inter alia  of advanced technological potentials for accelerated evidence 
synthesis, take stock of existing analyses and evidence on the performance of sectoral 
and horizontal instruments affecting climate -change mitigation and adaptation in the 
agricultural and forestry sectors, also in terms of the distribution of costs and benefits 
within and across sectors and societies; 
• design and carry out research to fill gaps in the understanding of the above questions, 
covering a broad range of policy instruments across relevant outcomes and include 
compound effects on other policy objectives as well as spill -overs from climate-relevant 
policies with a different (primary) objective, including biodiversity and nature 
protection; 
• for the agricultural and forestry sectors address adaptation as well as mitigation -related 
policies and outcomes and assess how (and with how much success) their 
interconnections have been reflected in relevant policies and institutions, identifying 
relevant enabling conditions; 
• develop frameworks for assessing overall policy outcomes across potentially conflicting 
objectives and identify specific leverage points for realistically improving aggregate 
outcomes, taking into account any existing review processes or mechanisms.  
This topic should involve the effective contribution of Social Sciences and Humanities (SSH) 
disciplines. Proposals are encouraged to consider, where relevant, the data, expertise and 
services offered by European research infrastructures in the environmental, biological and 
food domains.
