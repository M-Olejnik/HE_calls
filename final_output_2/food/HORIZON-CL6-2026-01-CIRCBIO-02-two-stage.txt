HORIZON-CL6-2026-01-CIRCBIO-02-two-stage: Open topic: Using the Circular Cities 
and Regions Initiative to strengthen urban manufacturing in support of the Clean 
Industrial Deal 
Call: Call 01 - two stage (2026) 
Specific conditions 
Expected EU 
contribution per 
project 
The Commission estimates that an EU contribution of around EUR 6.00 
million would allow these outcomes to be addressed appropriately. 
Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of a 
proposal requesting different amounts. 
Indicative budget The total indicative budget for the topic is EUR 18.00 million. 
Type of Action Innovation Actions 
 
Expected Outcome:   
 
Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes: 
• urban manufacturers significantly increase their resource efficiency through increased 
circular material use or reduced overall material use per output; 
• urban manufacturers contribute significantly to EU climate, zero pollution, circularity 
and biodiversity goals by engaging in clean, sustainable and circular business practices; 
• improved knowledge sharing and proliferation of digital tools and methods that facilitate 
the adoption of circular business practices and enable large-scale diffusion.   
Scope:   
The Clean Industrial Deal confirms Europe’s dedication to its decarbonisation goals by 
offering clear business incentives. It will help create lead markets to boost supply and demand 
in clean tech and energy -intensive industries (such as chemicals, cement, steel and metals), 
enabling the decarbonisation and industrial competitiveness of Europe at the same time. An 
integral focus is to support the acceleration of the roll -out of clean energy and manufacturing, 
to develop sectoral transition pathways and to reinforce a circular economy. 
The Clean Industrial Deal Communication states that “Research and Innovation (R&I) is a 
key enabler for promoting the next generation of clean tech, clean energy and decarbonised 
manufacturing in the EU. A flagship Horizon Europe call of ca. EUR 600 million under the 
2026-2027 work programme supports fit -for-deployment projects. This will aim at fostering 
synergies between the Framework Programme for R&I and the Innovation Fund, creating a 
pipeline of projects from R&I to deployment.” The topics of this flagship call focus 
exclusively on clean tech and energy -intensive industries as described above. Therefore, this 
topic complements the CID flagship call and aims to support the clean transition in a specific 
area outside the CID flagship call where the existing CCRI network can provide capacity and 
expertise. 
Proposals should: 
• implement and demonstrate circular systemic solutions that help urban manufacturers 
overcome key barriers and challenges in their clean and circular transition and in 
adapting to new requirements aiming to mitigate environmental degradation , climate 
change and biodiversity loss.  
Urban manufacturing is the production of goods in urban areas, designed considering local 
culture and characteristics and intended to be distributed to the same local communities. 
Urban manufacturing is characterised by the use of local resources. 
In view of the multiple crises since the financial crisis of 2008, it has become obvious that the 
reindustrialisation of Europe is necessary. As urban centres absorb a large percentage of the 
world’s population and resources, they are also increasingly exposed to pollution problems, 
social inequality and non -diversified economic activity and will need to become more 
resilient, self-sufficient and resourceful. That makes the return of local production, together 
with its jobs and innovation, not only desirable but essential.251 
The integration of urban manufacturing within a city necessitates the consideration of the 
relationship to the existing urban environment. Projects should therefore involve economic 
operators, local authorities, and civil society organisations. 
The topic requires the effective contribution of SSH disciplines and involvement of SSH 
experts in order to produce meaningful and significant effects enhancing the societal impact 
of the related activities. 
Proposals should seek to contribute to the goals and cooperate with the services of the 
European Commission’s Circular Cities and Regions Initiative (CCRI) and in particular with 
the CCRI Coordination and Support Office. Joint activities with other CCRI projects are 
strongly encouraged. Linkages with relevant initiatives such as the Regional Innovation 
Valleys, the New European Bauhaus and the Climate -Neutral and Smart Cities Mission 
should be explored whenever relevant. 
Proposals are expected to contribute to Europe’s competitiveness and sustainable prosperity 
by supporting the development of a more resilient circular economy in line with the EU 
Competitiveness Compass, the EU Clean Industrial Deal and the EU Circular Economy Act. 
In line with the CID flagship call, this is an open topic, allowing applicants to propose 
solutions that maximise competitiveness and sustainability through increased circularity, and 
that are fit for deployment in terms of technological and economic feasibility.
