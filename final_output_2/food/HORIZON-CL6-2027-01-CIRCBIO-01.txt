HORIZON-CL6-2027-01-CIRCBIO-01: Enhancing ecodesign and circularity of 
consumer electronics 
Call: Call 01 - single stage (2027) 
Specific conditions 
Expected EU 
contribution per 
project 
The Commission estimates that an EU contribution of around EUR 5.00 
million would allow these outcomes to be addressed appropriately. 
Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of a 
proposal requesting different amounts. 
Indicative budget The total indicative budget for the topic is EUR 10.00 million. 
Type of Action Innovation Actions 
 
Technology 
Readiness Level 
Activities are expected to achieve TRL 6 -8 by the end of the project – 
see General Annex B. 
Legal and financial 
set-up of the Grant 
Agreements 
The rules are described in General Annex G. The following exceptions 
apply: 
Eligible costs will take the form of a lump sum as defined in the 
Decision of 7 July 2021 authorising the use of lump sum contributions 
under the Horizon Europe Programme – the Framework Programme for 
Research and Innovation (2021 -2027) – and in actions under the 
Research and Training Programme of the European Atomic Energy 
Community (2021-2025) 252. 
 
Expected Outcome: Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected 
outcomes: 
• material and product manufacturers apply relevant ecodesign, including design for 
circularity and design for recycling principles in developing and manufacturing products 
that contribute significantly to EU climate and through reduction of emissions and 
resource extraction to biodiversity goals, zero pollution, water resilience, circular 
economy, as well as open strategic autonomy; 
• consumers benefit from more sustainable and circular products, i.e. durable, reliable, 
reusable, reparable, upgradable, recyclable products including increased recycled 
content.   
Scope: Electrical and electronic equipment continues to be one of the fastest growing waste 
streams in the EU, with current annual growth rates of 2%. It is estimated that less than 40% 
of electronic waste is collected in the EU. 253 Value is lost when fully or partially functional 
products are discarded because they are not reparable, the battery cannot be replaced, the 
software is no longer supported, or materials incorporated in devices are not recovered. 
Increasing recovery of critical raw materials from waste electrical and electronic equipment is 
a strategic priority to mitigate supply risks. Today, CRM recovery rates are generally low, 
with increases requiring new recovery processes and interface optimisation with pre -
processing to ensure appropriate material flows for efficient recovery are generated.254 
Proposals should: 
• develop, test and demonstrate new or improved ecodesign of consumer electronics, 
including design for durability, reusability, reparability, disassembly, separability, 
recyclability, uptake of recycled content. This may include design solutions for the reuse 
 
of components and for easier dismantling leading to increased reparability, 
remanufacturing or recycling with use of solutions and technologies such as active 
disassembly/debonding materials and adhesives, and design solutions targeting critical 
and strategic raw materials; 
• assess and provide recommendations for mechanisms and incentives to address the 
trade-offs with costs and innovation limitations and to reward design for circularity and 
product durability – such as extended guarantees, “second” VAT reduction, or others –, 
and test and demonstrate new business models such as leasing and product -service-
systems, to the extent that they reinforce positive design changes.   
Proposed solutions need to be aligned with chemical safety principles (SSbD) and in 
compliance with relevant legislation such as RoHS. The environmental performance of the 
proposed solutions in comparison to existing products should be evaluated from a lifecycle 
perspective using product environmental footprint methodology wherever applicable. 
Participation of partners from (associated) countries with actual electronics production is 
encouraged. Participation of SMEs is encouraged. Consumer benefits are at the centre of this 
topic, and it is vital that the consumer perspective is duly reflected in all activities. The topic 
requires the effective contribution of SSH disciplines and involvement of SSH experts in 
order to produce meaningful and significant effects enhancing the societal impact of the 
related activities. 
This topic supports the implementation of the European Green Deal, the Ecodesign for 
Sustainable Products Regulation and its working plan, in particular with a view to the 
reparability of small household appliances, the WEEE Directive, contribute to waste 
prevention, higher circularity and uptake of recyclate, and Europe’s efforts to develop a single 
market for sustainable products.
