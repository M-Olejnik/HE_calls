Call: Call 02 - single stage (2027) 
Specific conditions 
Expected EU 
contribution per 
The Commission estimates that an EU contribution of around EUR 
7.80 million would allow these outcomes to be addressed 
project appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and 
selection of a proposal requesting different amounts. 
Indicative budget The total indicative budget for the topic is EUR 7.80 million. 
Type of Action Innovation Actions 
Eligibility conditions The conditions are described in General Annex B. The following 
exceptions apply: 
Subject to restrictions for the protection of European communication 
networks.

Readiness Level 
Activities are expected to start from TRL 5 in order to achieve TRL 7 
by the end of the project – see General Annex B. 
Legal and financial 
set-up of the Grant 
Agreements 
The rules are described in General Annex G. The following 
exceptions apply: 
The granting authority may, up to 4 years after the end of the action, 
object to a transfer of ownership or to the exclusive licensing of 
results, as set out in the specific provision of Annex 5. 
 
Expected Outcome: Project results are expected to contribute to all the following expected 
outcomes: 
• an Artificial Intelligence (AI) tool able to accelerate the analysis of complex foodomics 
data to speed up the identification, structural characterisation, and quantification of 
chemicals present in food; 
• improving capacity and synergies in foodomics research between academia, research 
infrastructures and industry.  
Scope: Through food and beverages, the population is exposed to an immense variety of 
chemicals (as contaminants and as ingredients). The “foodome” is the complete set of 
compounds present in a food sample at a given time; it includes both endogenous 
biomolecules (produced through a species' metabolic processes) and exogenous compounds 
(natural and synthetic substances from production, processing, handling, and packaging). The 
current knowledge is largely confined to a narrow set of approximately 150 food c omponents 
catalogued by traditional databases. These components represent only a very small fraction of 
the total chemical complexity present in foods, while thousands (>100,000) of compounds 
and contaminants remain largely unquantified and underexplored. Understanding this 
“nutrient dark matter” would require identifying, cataloguing and quantifying the full 
spectrum of substances present in our food and present in accessible, AI -ready databases. The 
need for such information is today a bottleneck to make the nutrition field predictive and data 
driven, and has the potential to make food processing more efficient in bringing new foods 
items on the market. Efforts to create such datasets are underway but owing to the quantity of 
samples (hundreds of thousands of compounds across thousands of foods), such databases 
often rely on high -throughput experimental methods which do not allow a precise 
characterisation of the molecules identified. 
Proposals should address the following activities: 
• develop and test validated AI algorithms capable of interpreting and annotating high -
throughput foodomics data, for instance from untargeted mass -spectrometry or nuclear 
magnetic resonance; 
• the AI algorithms should be capable to predict or infer the presence and concentration of 
compounds based on (incomplete) foodomics data via innovative approaches, for 
instance by considering phylogenic relationships between species. Moreover, this should 
help identify analytical methods and potential food safety hazards based on their 
similarity to known compounds; 
• develop a European research and innovation network between Member States and 
Associated Countries in food exposome research to support the development, 
standardization, valorisation and dissemination of the AI results and considering existing 
initiatives such as the Centre for Excellence in the Periodic Table of Food Initiative from 
Wageningen University.  
The multi -actor approach is encouraged. Proposals should include industry in the consortia 
and academia, startups, SMEs and international initiatives. Collaboration with international 
partners is encouraged as well as with existing private companies in the EU/Associated 
countries.
