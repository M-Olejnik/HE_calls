HORIZON-CL6-2026-01-BIODIV-03: Pushing the frontier of knowledge and 
conservation action for deep sea ecosystems 
Call: Call 01 - single stage (2026) 
Specific conditions 
Expected EU 
contribution per 
project 
The Commission estimates that an EU contribution of around EUR 9.00 
million would allow these outcomes to be addressed appropriately. 
Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of a 
proposal requesting different amounts. 
Indicative budget The total indicative budget for the topic is EUR 18.00 million. 
Type of Action Research and Innovation Actions 
Eligibility 
conditions 
The conditions are described in General Annex B. The following 
exceptions apply: 
All international organisations are exceptionally eligible for funding. 
If projects use satellite -based earth observation, positioning, navigation 
and/or related timing data and services, beneficiaries must make use of 
Copernicus and/or Galileo/EGNOS (other data and services may 
additionally be used). 
 
Expected Outcome: Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected 
outcomes: 
• Member States and Associated Countries contribute to the implementation of area -based 
management tools, such as protection targets and adaptive management approaches for 
deep-sea regions under the Treaty on Biodiversity Beyond National Jurisdiction (BBNJ) 
and the Kunming -Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework (GBF), for Regional 
fisheries Management Organisations (RFMOs) and for transitions areas with the EU 
exclusive economic zone notably by identifying Ecologically and biologically significant 
marine areas (EBSAS), and informing the next Global Assessment of Biodiversity and 
Ecosystem Services; 
• Public Authorities prioritise deep sea areas for inclusion in their 30% protection target 
while enhancing maritime spatial planning achieved through science -based information, 
habitat mapping and ecosystem -based approach, aligned with the EU strategies for 
biodiversity and climate adaptation by 2030.  
Scope: The deep sea represents 90% of the Ocean volume and remains the least explored 
biome of the planet. Nevertheless, we know that the deep sea forms an extensive and complex 
ensemble of ecosystems which functioning is crucial to the rest of the biosphere, global 
biogeochemical cycles and ecosystems upon which much terrestrial life, including human 
civilisation, depends. The critical limiting factors in the definition and implementation of 
protection and restoration measures are the lack of biodiversity knowledge and appropriate 
monitoring, especially in layers below 1000 m. The main reasons are the limited access and 
high cost of explorations of the diversity of biotopes in the deep sea, and the resources 
available to identify organisms across the full range of sizes (from microorganisms to 
megafauna) and describe ecosystems functioning. 
In line with the objectives and targets of the EU biodiversity strategy for 2030, the EU Nature 
Restoration Regulation, the Marine Strategy Framework Directive, the EU climate adaptation 
strategy, the strategy for European life sciences, the European Ocean Pact, the Treaty on 
Biodiversity Beyond National Jurisdiction (BBNJ) and the Kunming -Montreal Global 
Biodiversity Framework (GBF), proposals should: 
• fill the gaps in geographical coverage in habitats mapping, species inventory, genetic 
diversity, ecological functioning, food webs and ecological connectivity (including 
migratory species) of deep sea ecosystems in the bathypelagic and abyssopelagic zones 
(abyssal seafloor, hydrothermal sites, seamounts, canyons and across the water column) 
between them and with shallower ocean zones (mesopelagic, epipelagic, coastal...); 
• develop, integrate and deploy imaging, acoustic, multi -omics, genomics and taxonomic 
technologies and methodologies for the inventory and fast identification of deep -sea 
marine species from microbes, invertebrates to migratory species, apex predators such as 
sharks and mammals, corals and other habitat -forming species, generating reference 
datasets from identified voucher specimens and novel methods to improve biodiversity 
monitoring and inventory and the discovery of novel biological traits, enhancing 
understanding of ecosystem resilience to climate and anthropogenic pressures; 
• contribute to the Global Taxonomy Initiative of the Convention on Biological Diversity 
(CBD) and to free and open access to the Global Biodiversity Information Facility’s 
biodiversity data; 
• establish baselines, spatial and temporal dynamics, assess and predict the cumulated 
impacts from climate change and other anthropogenic stressors including underwater 
noise, on ecosystems functioning and services, including the biological carbon pump 
fisheries stock; 
• describe holistic interactions between the deep sea, Ocean and planetary health and 
propose actionable knowledge by involving multiple stakeholders for identifying 
adaptive management approaches, and mitigation and conservation scenarios for 
prioritised deep sea areas to reduce impacts of climate change and other anthropogenic 
stressors on ecosystem structure and functioning; 
• identify the indicators and thresholds, such as Essential Ocean Variables (EOV) and 
Essential Biodiversity Variables (EBV) and propose cost -effective observation 
approaches and the data integration, for the long -term monitoring and the modelling of 
deep-sea biodiversity and ecosystems functioning, covering oxygen concentration, 
carbon fluxes, nutrients and biogeochemistry, to inform management on impacts and 
conservation or mitigation measures.  
Proposals should foresee dedicated tasks and resources for cooperating with projects funded 
under this topic as well as with other relevant international, Horizon Europe and Horizon 
2020 projects on marine biodiversity, functional ecology and on observation, mapping, 
monitoring and modelling. Proposals should also foresee appropriate resources to ensure close 
cooperation with the EC Knowledge Centre for Biodiversity (KCBD) and its Science Service. 
International cooperation is encouraged.
