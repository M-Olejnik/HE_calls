HORIZON-CL6-2027-02-FARM2FORK-03: Microbiome for terrestrial livestock 
sustainability and health within a One Health approach 
Call: Call 02 - single stage (2027) 
Specific conditions 
Expected EU 
contribution per 
project 
The Commission estimates that an EU contribution of between EUR 
5.00 and 6.00 million would allow these outcomes to be addressed 
appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and 
selection of a proposal requesting different amounts. 
Indicative budget The total indicative budget for the topic is EUR 11.80 million. 
Type of Action Research and Innovation Actions 
Legal and financial 
set-up of the Grant 
Agreements 
The rules are described in General Annex G. The following exceptions 
apply: 
Eligible costs will take the form of a lump sum as defined in the 
Decision of 7 July 2021 authorising the use of lump sum contributions 
under the Horizon Europe Programme – the Framework Programme for 
Research and Innovation (2021 -2027) – and in actions under the 
Research and Training Programme of the European Atomic Energy 
Community (2021-2025) 198. 
 
Expected Outcome: Project results are expected to contribute to all the following expected 
outcomes: 
• the research community, farmers, livestock industry e.g. breeders, service providers, 
policymakers understand better the role of the microbiome on livestock health and 
production and the interaction with environment and human health within a One Health 
approach; 
• researchers' communities and innovators in the livestock sector have access to a platform 
of tools for data sharing, knowledge exchange, capacity building and standardization in 
microbiome research and its applications through synergies with other platforms in a 
One Health context; 
• targeted strategies and guidelines are available to farmers, service providers and 
livestock industry to contribute to improving livestock health, while reducing 
antimicrobial use and environmental impact, and securing animal welfare.  
 
Scope: Microbiome research offers transformative potential for livestock management within 
the One Health (OH) framework, which emphasises the interconnected health of animals, 
humans, and the environment. In livestock, microbiome innovation can address pressing 
issues such as antimicrobial resistance (AMR) and zoonotic disease transmission. However, 
gaps persist in understanding the role of variability within host -microbiome interactions, in 
developing sustainable farming practices, and assessing these interventions in real -world 
farming settings. Advancing microbiome research can enhance animal health and 
productivity, improve ecosystems, while reducing environmental and climate impacts. By 
focusing on microbiome -based solutions, the objective is to support sustainable livestock 
systems that align with OH principles, necessitating cross -disciplinary collaboration to ensure 
comprehensive health benefits. 
Proposals should address all of the following activities: 
• investigate the microbiome of terrestrial livestock, their influence on animal health, 
taking into account the holobiont/hologenome perspectives, and the interactions with the 
environment (soil, plant, water, air) and human health; 
• develop integrated data monitoring systems that track microbiome related health 
indicators across livestock, plant, and human health sectors, and help in risk assessment 
models for zoonotic disease and/or AMR emergence and transmission; 
• assess how microbiome-based solutions for animal health affect, and are affected by, soil 
and plant health, and the use of chemical fertilisers and pesticides; 
• design holistic health models that incorporate microbiome research to enhance the 
robustness of animals as well as animal health and welfare, and overall productivity, 
taking into account soil and plant health, and to assess potential synergies and trade -offs 
between these objectives; 
• design microbiome related intervention strategies to prevent outbreaks and cross -species 
transmission in animal populations and reduce the risk of zoonosis, thereby contributing 
to reduced antimicrobial usage while enhancing resilience, animal welfare, and 
minimizing environmental impact; 
• develop, or contribute to, platforms to collaboratively assess and optimise the efficacy 
and implementation of microbiome -based tools, products and services in the livestock 
sector through synergies with other platforms within a One Health context; 
• enhance collaboration among veterinarians, microbiologists, geneticists, animal and 
plant biologists, epidemiologists, and ecologists and other experts to work towards a One 
Health approach.  
Projects selected under this topic should interact between themselves and build on/interact 
with recent or on -going EU funded projects and initiatives, including those funded under the 
topic HORIZON -CL6-2026-02-FARM2FORK-11: Integrating a holistic perspective in 
microbiome research for resilient, competitive and sustainable food systems, as well as with 
relevant activities of the European partnerships on animal health and welfare, on One health 
AMR, and on pandemic preparedness. 
The projects under this topic are relevant to the EU policies related to the EU Green Deal’s 
goals for resilient and sustainable agri -food systems, the EU biodiversity strategy for 2030, 
the Life Sciences strategy, the Vision for Agriculture and Food, the EU One Health Action 
Plan against Antimicrobial Resistance, and the Council Recommendation on stepping up EU 
actions to combat antimicrobial resistance in a One Health approach.
