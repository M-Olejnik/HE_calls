HORIZON-CL6-2026-01-CIRCBIO-10: Bio-based innovation in society: supporting the 
sustainable way of living 
Call: Call 01 - single stage (2026) 
Specific conditions 
Expected EU 
contribution per 
project 
The Commission estimates that an EU contribution of around EUR 4.00 
million would allow these outcomes to be addressed appropriately. 
Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of a 
proposal requesting different amounts. 
Indicative budget The total indicative budget for the topic is EUR 8.00 million. 
Type of Action Research and Innovation Actions 
Technology 
Readiness Level 
Activities are expected to achieve TRL 4 -5 by the end of the project – 
see General Annex B. Activities may start at any TRL. 
Legal and financial 
set-up of the Grant 
Agreements 
The rules are described in General Annex G. The following exceptions 
apply: 
Eligible costs will take the form of a lump sum as defined in the 
Decision of 7 July 2021 authorising the use of lump sum contributions 
under the Horizon Europe Programme – the Framework Programme for 
Research and Innovation (2021 -2027) – and in actions under the 
Research and Training Programme of the European Atomic Energy 
Community (2021-2025) 244. 
 
Expected Outcome: Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected 
outcomes: 
• advanced socio-economic transformation based on scientific/technological opportunities 
delivered by the bio -based sectors and bioeconomy. This will result in innovative bio -
based products and services, supporting the more sustainable way of living (e.g. new 
socio-economic models), higher circularity, affordability, resource efficiency, climate 
neutrality etc); 
• improved public understanding and engagement in bio -based innovation underpinned by 
scientific advances in life sciences and biotechnology; 
 
• better living conditions for individuals and communities, benefiting from less polluted 
ecosystems, via healthier, and environmentally sustainable products and services with a 
reduced carbon footprint and based on circular and bio-based solutions.  
Scope: The projects under this topic are relevant to the EU policies related to the European 
Commission communication on: Building the future with nature: Boosting Biotechnology and 
Biomanufacturing in the EU, the Strategy for European Life Sciences, the EU Biotech Act, 
Clean Industrial Deal and the policies related to the fair green transition (objective of not 
leaving anyone behind). It also contributes to the Start -ups and Scale-ups strategy. Synergies 
with activities under the Circular Bio -based Europe (CBE) Joint Undertaking and New 
European Bauhaus are encouraged. 
Proposals should address the following activities: 
• develop the innovative user-friendly bio-based products and/or services, underpinned by 
biotechnology and biomanufacturing approaches, to support the more sustainable 
applications with a clear societal benefit, such as less resource-intensive consumer 
goods, to reduce environmental and climate pressures. Foresee the necessary links with 
the digital technologies and tools (e.g., bioinformatics, AI, etc.); 
• assess the potential of new socio -economic models for circular and bio -based systems, 
integrating aspects of environmental justice, gender equality, diversity and social 
inclusion, as well as relevant international global best practice, via e.g. societal 
dialogue/innovation, social impact assessment, involvement and inputs from the social 
sciences and humanities (SSH); 
• include research and innovation activities to understand and increase the level of current 
public perception and acceptance, including the benefits / risks, addressing the consumer 
perspective, market acceptance and understanding of the bio-based innovation, as well as 
delivering higher understanding of consumption patterns and social demands; 
• foresee the cooperation and feedback loops with industry and authorities, in respect to 
any new market solutions proposed.  
The multi -actor approach is encouraged. Proposals should involve SMEs – both as project 
beneficiaries or external actors - and offer opportunities to newcomers to Horizon Europe 
Cluster 6, as well as engage with the civil society stakeholders such as NGOs and consumer 
organisations to advance scale-up and facilitate future market deployment. 
Cooperation with projects funded under parallel topics such as HORIZON -CL6-2026-01-
CIRCBIO-07: Advancing the European bio -based innovation enabled by biotechnology and 
biomanufacturing concepts is encouraged to maximise synergies, while avoiding overlaps. 
Cooperation between all projects funded under this topic should also be foreseen, as a specific 
tasks, with an allocation of resources, for synergies. 
Proposals should integrate the gender dimension and consider other social categories besides 
gender (disability, age, socio -economic status, ethnic and/or cultural origin, sexual 
orientation, etc.), and their intersections. 
This topic requires the effective contribution of SSH disciplines and involvement of SSH 
experts in order to produce meaningful and significant effects enhancing the societal impact 
of the related research activities. International cooperation is encouraged.
