farmers through improved capacity in coping with risks and crises 
Call: Call 03 - single stage (2027) 
Specific conditions 
Expected EU 
contribution per 
project 
The Commission estimates that an EU contribution of around EUR 6.00 
million would allow these outcomes to be addressed appropriately. 
Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of a 
 
proposal requesting different amounts. 
Indicative budget The total indicative budget for the topic is EUR 12.00 million. 
Type of Action Research and Innovation Actions 
Eligibility 
conditions 
The conditions are described in General Annex B. The following 
exceptions apply: 
The following additional eligibility criteria apply: the proposals must 
apply the multi -actor approach. See definition of the multi -actor 
approach in this work programme part. 
The Joint Research Centre (JRC) may participate as member of the 
consortium selected for funding as a beneficiary with zero funding, or 
as an associated partner. The JRC will not participate in the preparation 
and submission of the proposal - see General Annex B. 
Legal and financial 
set-up of the Grant 
Agreements 
The rules are described in General Annex G. The following exceptions 
apply: 
Eligible costs will take the form of a lump sum as defined in the 
Decision of 7 July 2021 authorising the use of lump sum contributions 
under the Horizon Europe Programme – the Framework Programme for 
Research and Innovation (2021 -2027) – and in actions under the 
Research and Training Programme of the European Atomic Energy 
Community (2021-2025) 355. 
 
Expected Outcome: Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected 
outcomes: 
• the capacity of farmers and other agri -food supply chain operators to prevent, prepare 
for, cope with and manage diverse risks and crises, considering potential compound and 
amplifier effects under climate change, and their impacts, is improved in an integrated 
way; 
• policymakers benefit from evidence and better understanding on how to enable more 
effective strategies for prevention and management of diverse risks and crises affecting 
farmers, considering compound and amplifier effects of climate change and biodiversity 
loss; 
• knowledge and solutions to improve the resilience of farming systems are available and 
accessible to farmers and other agri -food supply chain operators through active and 
effective dissemination and engagement activities.  
 
Scope: Farmers are exposed to numerous and increasing risks and crises of diverse nature and 
scale, putting pressure on their wellbeing, business viability and income. So far, available risk 
and crisis management tools have been insufficient in addressing the growing needs for 
strengthening resilience capacities. There is a need for more knowledge and solutions adapted 
to the diversity of farming systems and contexts. This would enable more integrated 
management of risks and crises, leading to more effective emergency response and adequate 
prevention and management on the long term. Proposals should target one or more risks and 
crises (e.g., sanitary, environmental, economic, geopolitical, ecological, demographic, 
technological) that are causing, or likely to cause, significant socio -economic impacts directly 
or indirectly affecting EU farmers, considering among others potential compound and 
amplifier effects under climate change and biodiversity loss. 
The actions funded under this topic should support the EU policies related to the EU Vision 
for Agriculture and Food and the Common Agricultural Policy. 
Proposals should: 
• improve understanding of farmers’ individual and collective options, strategies, 
incentives, behaviour and decision -making regarding uncertainties, risk and crisis 
management. This work should capture the context in which farmers operate, including 
interactions with other agri-food supply chain operators, critical dependencies, as well as 
market conditions and policies; 
• assess the anticipation, robustness and adaptation capacities of farms, costs and benefits 
of action vs. non -action, and the interactions between risk management, crisis 
management and the adoption of preventive practices on farms, at landscape level and/or 
along agri -food supply chains. This work should also analyse the transformative 
capacities of farms in response to challenges that make business as usual not viable or 
not possible; 
• propose inclusive solutions, improve and develop integrated risk and crisis management 
strategies, at farm and landscape level and/or along the agri -food supply chain, to 
improve the resilience of farming systems. Proposed solutions should consider different 
types of production and the risk perceptions of practitioners, and they should be adapted 
to the practitioners’ risk preferences and resilience requirements. This work should also 
include an assessment of the costs and benefits of the solutions; 
• propose criteria and measures to improve fair risk sharing along the agri -food supply 
chain and for derisking, to mitigate economic risks for farmers; 
• test the proposed strategies and/or measures, using an experimental approach. Proposals 
are encouraged to build for this purpose on existing participatory infrastructures (e.g., 
demonstration sites, living labs, etc); 
• support inclusive and accessible capacity building, training, and education on risk and 
crisis management for farmers and other relevant agri -food supply chain operators (“risk 
literacy”); 
• consider compound and amplifier effects of climate change and biodiversity loss on 
other types of risks and crises in all activities whenever appropriate and relevant.  
Proposals should assess and compare options and strategies developed by farmers 
implementing various farming approaches, one of which should be organic farming. 
The Joint Research Centre (JRC) may participate as member of the consortium selected for 
funding. The JRC’s participation could involve contributing to the understanding of farmer 
risk preferences, measurement and design of risk sharing alternatives for the agri -food supply 
chain and testing alternatives using experimental methods. 
Proposals should capitalise on existing relevant research findings and tools. They should also 
ensure complementarities with other relevant EU -funded projects, including from the EU 
Missions on Adaptation to Climate Change and on Soil. Proposals should also ensure 
synergies with other relevant EU-funded studies (e.g., fi-compass studies), projects, initiatives 
and processes. 
Proposals should include a dedicated task, appropriate resources and a plan on how they will 
collaborate with other projects selected under this topic (e.g., by participating in joint 
activities, workshops, as well as common communication and dissemination activities, etc.). 
The selected projects are also expected to collaborate with relevant projects selected under the 
topic HORIZON-CL6-2027-02-CLIMATE-03: Strengthening evidence -based policies for the 
resilience of European agriculture and forestry and related supply chains against crises and 
systemic risks. 
Proposals must implement the multi -actor approach, with a consortium based on a balanced 
mix of actors with complementary knowledge, including farmers, researchers, government 
representatives, agri -food supply chain operators (e.g., processors), and civil society 
organisations. 
This topic should involve the effective contribution of Social Sciences and Humanities (SSH) 
disciplines. 
International cooperation is encouraged.
