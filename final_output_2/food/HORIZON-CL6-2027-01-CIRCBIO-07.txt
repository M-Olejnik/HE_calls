HORIZON-CL6-2027-01-CIRCBIO-07: Improving biomass flows for a sustainable and 
circular bioeconomy 
Call: Call 01 - single stage (2027) 
Specific conditions 
Expected EU 
contribution per 
project 
The Commission estimates that an EU contribution of around EUR 7.00 
million would allow these outcomes to be addressed appropriately. 
Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of a 
proposal requesting different amounts. 
Indicative budget The total indicative budget for the topic is EUR 14.00 million. 
Type of Action Innovation Actions 
Technology 
Readiness Level 
Activities are expected to achieve TRL 6 -8 by the end of the project – 
see General Annex B. 
Legal and financial 
set-up of the Grant 
Agreements 
The rules are described in General Annex G. The following exceptions 
apply: 
Eligible costs will take the form of a lump sum as defined in the 
Decision of 7 July 2021 authorising the use of lump sum contributions 
under the Horizon Europe Programme – the Framework Programme for 
Research and Innovation (2021 -2027) – and in actions under the 
Research and Training Programme of the European Atomic Energy 
Community (2021-2025) 266. 
 
Expected Outcome:   
Project results are expected to contribute to all the following expected outcomes: 
• enhanced capacity of private and public stakeholders to increase resource efficiency in 
collecting, processing and using primary and secondary biomass, ensuring that 
ecosystems and biodiversity are protected and restored, emissions of greenhouse gases 
and pollutants reduced, and human needs for biomass satisfied in sufficient and fair way, 
including food security; 
• increased environmental, social and economic value added from the various uses of 
biomass, including bio-waste, e.g. food losses and food waste; 
• reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and (air, water and soil) pollution, due to 
avoiding landfilling and incineration of bio-waste; 
 
• demonstrated environmental, social and economic and social benefits for the 
municipalities involved in the collection and provision of bio-waste.   
Scope: Successful proposals should contribute to the implementation of the new EU 
bioeconomy strategy and its action plan; and the Waste Framework Directive and the Landfill 
Directive, e.g. on bio -waste management. Project outcomes will contribute to the objectives 
of the recent initiatives on Circular Economy, Biotechnology, Competitiveness, the Clean 
Industrial Deal, the Vision for Agriculture and Food and Life Sciences. 
Bioeconomy provides solutions to various challenges. However, companies see themselves 
challenged to satisfy the growing demand for biomass in the future. There are solutions to 
increase the sustainable production, including to reduce pollutants, and adjust the demand, e.g. 
better valorise unused/under -exploited sustainable biomass resources (including unavoidable 
food waste and industrial residues), and degraded land, apply new breeding techniques and 
increase resource efficiency through circular design and circular business and consumption 
models. 
Bio-waste represents a vast underutilised biomass resource with substantial potential for 
valorisation. Private and public actors that aggregate biomass waste streams, pretreat them 
and standardise them for further valorisation are well placed to foster its improved use. In 
addition, they play an essential role to increase the transparency of biomass waste supply 
flows and to provide platforms to match supply and demand. By supporting these types of 
actors, Europe can increase its capacity to transform more bio -waste into valuable 
commodities and contribute to sustainable and circular bioeconomy objectives and solutions 
based on biological resources (including ecosystems). 
Proposals should address all the following activities: 
• study and optimise business models for the aggregation, pre-treatment, standardisation 
and primary valorisation of under -utilised biomass resources, including bio -waste from 
food losses and food waste and/or primary production/industrial biogenic residues. 
Engage with local governments to create compelling business cases and to showcase best 
practices that highlight the environmental, social and economic, benefits of bio -waste 
valorisation. In this context, the successful proposals should collaborate with local 
communities and stakeholders to ensure that biomass valorisation practices are socially 
acceptable and beneficial to communities, the environment and the economy; 
• support local, regional, and national bioeconomy actors, and develop new or strengthen 
existing platforms (at least 5) by connecting biomass suppliers, and users, both in urban 
and rural settings; provide guidance and links to local, regional, or national biomass 
plans; and facilitate business decisions, especially for SMEs. Additionally, map and 
study various types of platforms, potentially also digital marketplaces, that match 
biomass supply and demand within local, regional, and EU contexts; 
• identify barriers to and best available practices for the development of biomass platforms 
(e.g. end-of-waste criteria), and provide recommendations to address them, in national, 
regional and EU context; 
• develop tools and innovative approaches to optimize bio -waste collection, processing 
and logistics, enhancing resource efficiency and ecosystem health, as well as reducing 
costs. Exploit the potential of digital solutions to improve the traceability and 
management of bio -waste streams. Advance innovative and competitive business 
solutions, developing and testing technological innovations for biomass aggregation, 
pretreatment, and standardisation, including from under -utilised biomass resources, and 
processing towards added-value products.  
Proposals should pay particular attention to areas where biomass is neither fully valorised nor 
utilised to its full potential, such as Central and Eastern Europe, Ukraine and other EU 
candidate countries. 
Proposals are encouraged to work together with relevant initiatives including those of the 
European Commission’s Joint Research Centre (Knowledge Centre for Bioeconomy, 
Bioeconomy Monitoring System, the EU Food Systems Monitoring Dashboard), the Circular 
Biobased Europe Joint Undertaking, the European Circular Economy Stakeholder Platform, 
the New European Bauhaus and BIOEAST Initiative; as well as considering the topic 
‘HORIZON-CL6-2026-CIRCBIO-10: Understanding biomass flows in Europe’. When 
addressing the collection, pre -treatment and valorisation of food losses and waste, proposals 
should explore potential links with the work of the EU Platform on Food Losses and Food 
Waste. 
The multi -actor approach should be followed, involving concerned actors such as primary 
producers, industry representatives, regional/local authorities, research institutions.
