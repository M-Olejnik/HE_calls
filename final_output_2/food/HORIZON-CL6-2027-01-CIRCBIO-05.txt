HORIZON-CL6-2027-01-CIRCBIO-05: Innovative circular solutions for end -of-life 
footwear through collection, sorting and recycling 
Call: Call 01 - single stage (2027) 
Specific conditions 
Expected EU 
contribution per 
project 
The Commission estimates that an EU contribution of between EUR 
4.00 and 5.00 million would allow these outcomes to be addressed 
appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and 
selection of a proposal requesting different amounts. 
Indicative budget The total indicative budget for the topic is EUR 9.00 million. 
Type of Action Research and Innovation Actions 
Technology 
Readiness Level 
Activities are expected to achieve TRL 4 -5 by the end of the project – 
see General Annex B. Activities may start at any TRL. 
Legal and financial 
set-up of the Grant 
Agreements 
The rules are described in General Annex G. The following exceptions 
apply: 
Eligible costs will take the form of a lump sum as defined in the 
Decision of 7 July 2021 authorising the use of lump sum contributions 
under the Horizon Europe Programme – the Framework Programme for 
Research and Innovation (2021 -2027) – and in actions under the 
Research and Training Programme of the European Atomic Energy 
Community (2021-2025) 261. 
 
Expected Outcome: Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected 
outcomes: 
• all relevant stakeholders, including consumers, economic and social economy operators 
and waste managers, have an improved understanding of the technical, environmental, 
economic and social challenges and benefits to circularity in the footwear industry; 
• economic operators and waste managers are provided with evidence -based, innovative, 
cost-effective, and scalable solutions that improve the management of end -of-life 
footwear products, valorise post -consumer footwear waste materials and increase the 
circularity of the value chain; 
 
• consumers have access to user -friendly solutions to correctly dispose of end -of-life 
footwear, thus reducing landfill, improving sustainability practices, supporting them in 
making more conscious choices, and contributing to climate change mitigation and 
adaptation by reducing waste and promoting circular economy practices.  
Scope: The transition to a circular economy requires innovative solutions to manage end -of-
life products, including footwear, which can have significant environmental and climate 
impacts if landfilled and not properly collected, sorted, and recycled. In line with the EU's 
ambitious circular economy targets and policies, such as the Waste Framework Directive and 
the Ecodesign for Sustainable Products Regulation, this topic aims at improving the 
circularity of the footwear value chain and reducing the environmental footprint of end -of-life 
post-consumer footwear, whilst promoting a more regenerative and restorative approach to 
the footwear value chain and the stakeholders involved. 
Proposals should: 
• assess the technical, environmental, economic and social challenges and benefits linked 
to the transition of the footwear industry towards circularity, particularly in the 
collection, sorting and recycling of post-consumer footwear waste; 
• develop and test new methods and technologies that facilitate the collection, sorting, 
preparation for reuse and recycling of post -consumer footwear products, integrating 
digital tools (including AI) and the use of the Digital Product Passport to enable reuse 
and recycling, and minimise the release of hazardous chemicals and microplastics during 
the recycling process;  
• explore and develop innovative business models that enable the transition towards a 
circular and sustainable footwear value chain, promote the uptake of design for 
preparing for reuse and recycling, enable the development of take -back solutions and 
stimulate informed consumer choices and sustainable consumption patterns; 
• develop and test innovative solutions that facilitate the collaboration between the 
relevant stakeholders, including footwear manufacturers, retailers, consumers and waste 
managers, to ensure the effectiveness and uptake of the proposed solutions, including 
strategies for managing hazardous chemicals and microplastics in footwear waste.  
Successful proposals should bring together all relevant stakeholders active in the footwear 
value chain, namely industry representatives, SMEs, brand owners, producers, retailers, local 
authorities, waste managers, economic operators, consumer organisations, researchers, and 
NGOs. 
The topic supports EU policies, particularly the European Green Deal, the Ecodesign for 
Sustainable Products Regulation and its working plan, as well as the zero pollution action 
plan. The proposed solutions should also be consistent with the Waste Framework Directive, 
the Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) for textiles, the Clean Industrial Deal and the EU 
Circular Economy Act, supporting Europe’s efforts to develop a single market for sustainable 
products. 
This topic requires the effective contribution of SSH disciplines and the involvement of SSH 
experts, institutions as well as the inclusion of relevant SSH expertise, in order to produce 
meaningful and significant effects enhancing the societal impact of the related research 
activities.
