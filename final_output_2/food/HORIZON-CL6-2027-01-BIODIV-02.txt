HORIZON-CL6-2027-01-BIODIV-02: Science -policy support to the implementation of 
EU and global biodiversity policies and strategies 
Call: Call 01 - single stage (2027) 
Specific conditions 
Expected EU 
contribution per 
project 
The Commission estimates that an EU contribution of around EUR 7.00 
million would allow these outcomes to be addressed appropriately. 
Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of a 
proposal requesting different amounts. 
Indicative budget The total indicative budget for the topic is EUR 7.00 million. 
Type of Action Coordination and Support Actions 
Eligibility 
conditions 
The conditions are described in General Annex B. The following 
exceptions apply: 
The Joint Research Centre (JRC) may participate as member of the 
consortium selected for funding as a beneficiary with zero funding, or 
as an associated partner. The JRC will not participate in the preparation 
and submission of the proposal - see General Annex B. 
Legal and financial 
set-up of the Grant 
Agreements 
The rules are described in General Annex G. The following exceptions 
apply: 
Eligible costs will take the form of a lump sum as defined in the 
Decision of 7 July 2021 authorising the use of lump sum contributions 
under the Horizon Europe Programme – the Framework Programme for 
Research and Innovation (2021 -2027) – and in actions under the 
Research and Training Programme of the European Atomic Energy 
Community (2021-2025) 117. 
Beneficiaries may provide financial support to third parties. The support 
to third parties can only be provided in the form of grants. The 
 
maximum amount to be granted to each third party is EUR 120 000 as 
this support to third parties is one of the primary activities of the action 
and necessary to engage relevant expertise from the broader research 
community in order to be able to achieve its objectives. 
 
Expected Outcome: Project results are expected to contribute to all the following expected 
outcomes: 
• effective scientific support is provided by the Science Service for Biodiversity to all 
levels of policymaking related to biodiversity, through the European Commission’s 
Knowledge Centre for Biodiversity (KCBD); in particular, the coordination of answering 
ad hoc policy requests related to biodiversity through the mobilisation of the EU -funded 
scientific community, in collaboration with the KCBD, is expected; 
• enhanced science-policy support and knowledge transfer from EU -funded R&I projects 
to the Intergovernmental Science -Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem 
Services (IPBES) and the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) are ensured; 
• a strengthened, multi -stakeholder knowledge and dialogue platform promotes 
biodiversity knowledge and the uptake and scaling of nature -based solutions (NbS) 
including for nature protection and restoration across the EU and beyond, through active 
engagement with practitioners, developers, and decision -makers from science, policy, 
business, and civil society - at local, national, and international levels.  
Scope: The EU biodiversity strategy for 2030 includes a science -policy mechanism and 
greater efforts to support the implementation of biodiversity commitments at EU and global 
levels. The strategy also explicitly calls for the use of NbS as a central component in 
addressing both biodiversity loss and climate change. In line with the Commission’s priority 
'A global Europe’, the EU is demonstrating leadership in this field, notably by enhancing its 
support to the multilateral processes and platforms addressing the biodiversity crisis. This 
topic covers essential functions of the Science Service for Biodiversity, broader science -
policy support for multiple actors in relation to the global IPBES and CBD processes, as well 
as support to collaborations and knowledge exchange specifically on NbS. The Science 
Service, linked to the KCBD, plays a critical role in supporting evidence -based decision 
making within the EU. In addition, the KCBD acts as one of the European Technical and 
Scientific Support Centres (TSCs) established under the CBD, which support knowledge 
transfer and capacity building to help CBD Parties implement the Kunming -Montreal Global 
Biodiversity Framework (GBF). 
Proposals should: 
• support the provision of a functional Science Service for Biodiversity, in close 
collaboration with the KCBD, acting as a one -stop-shop – a single -entry point for 
providing the overall support on evidence -based services (answering knowledge 
requests, tools, coordination, capacity building) that enable policymakers, other decision 
makers and stakeholders in Europe and beyond to ensure the protection, restoration and 
sustainable use of biodiversity. Successful proposals should:        
 provide high -quality evidence -based responses to biodiversity -related policy 
requests submitted to the KCBD, by involving relevant researchers, particularly 
those from EU-funded projects. Proposals are expected to provide financial support 
to third parties (FSTP) to, for instance, involve relevant experts;    
 maintain and extend active knowledge exchange networks, including through 
capacity building, to strengthen the bridge between policy, science and society;    
 maintain, enrich and expand a set of Science Service tools, enabling all relevant 
actors to use and benefit from the best available biodiversity knowledge;   
• strengthen the capacity of researchers and negotiators from the EU and Associated 
Countries to engage in IPBES and CBD processes. Successful proposals should:        
 provide scientific and back -office support to negotiators involved in these 
processes;    
 facilitate and support the engagement of researchers from the EU and Associated 
Countries in these processes. Proposals are expected to provide financial support to 
third parties (FSTP) to, for instance, involve relevant experts;    
 facilitate technical and scientific cooperation, knowledge transfer and networking 
between researchers, stakeholders, policymakers and other decision makers to 
enhance awareness and application of IPBES deliverables;    
 support the KCBD in its tasks as a European TSC mobilising and/or generating 
evidence and knowledge to implement the GBF.   
• enhance and expand dynamic knowledge exchange mechanisms on NbS, coupled with 
targeted capacity-building initiatives, to reinforce the interface between policy, scientific 
research, business and societal engagement. Successful proposals should also:         
 ensure a multi -stakeholder dialogue platform on NbS serves to bridge science, 
policy, practice, and business, fostering the co -creation, dissemination, and uptake 
of research -based knowledge. This platform should play a key role in promoting 
policy coherence, encouraging collaborative action, and building capacity among 
Member States and Associated Countries, communities, and actors at all levels.   
Successful proposals should support the new Commission policy priorities for 2024 -2029 
with a focus on “Sustaining our quality of life: food security, water and nature”. This implies 
support to the implementation of the goals of the European Green Deal, the EU biodiversity 
strategy for 2030, the GBF and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). This requires 
interactions with IPBES, the CBD Secretariat, and the EC via the KCBD. Knowledge 
generated under this topic is also expected to inform deliberations on EU biodiversity policy 
after 2030. 
Proposals should build on existing knowledge and the results of past and on -going projects, 
and foresee close collaboration with, and tailored support to the KCBD and its Science 
Service. The possible participation of the European Commission’s Joint Research Centre 
(JRC) in the project would facilitate this collaboration and support. Proposals should also 
foresee cooperation with the European Biodiversity Partnership (Biodiversa+) and its funded 
projects. Proposal aspects addressing the platform on NbS should build upon the foundations 
and outcomes of the NetworkNaturePLUS project. 
Proposals are strongly encouraged to provide financial support to third parties (FSTP) to, for 
instance, respond to biodiversity -related policy requests or engage relevant expertise in 
IPBES and CBD processes. A maximum of 30% of the EU funding should be allocated to this 
purpose. Consortia need to define a fair and transparent selection process for third parties, for 
which financial support may be granted. Proposals should clearly demonstrate how the project 
will support the engagement of leading researchers from the EU and Associated Countries in 
IPBES and CBD processes. 
The Plan for exploitation and dissemination should ensure the valorisation of available 
knowledge to policy makers, stakeholders and the public.
