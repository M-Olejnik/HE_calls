HORIZON-CL6-2027-01-CIRCBIO-10: Strengthening forest research for the support 
of Ukraine 
Specific conditions 
Expected EU 
contribution per 
project 
The Commission estimates that an EU contribution of around EUR 6.00 
million would allow these outcomes to be addressed appropriately. 
Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of a 
proposal requesting different amounts. 
Indicative budget The total indicative budget for the topic is EUR 6.00 million. 
Type of Action Research and Innovation Actions 
Eligibility 
conditions 
The conditions are described in General Annex B. The following 
exceptions apply: 
The following additional eligibility criteria apply: the participation of at 
least one research institution or relevant public authority from Ukraine 
in the consortium is mandatory. 
Legal and financial 
set-up of the Grant 
Agreements 
The rules are described in General Annex G. The following exceptions 
apply: 
Eligible costs will take the form of a lump sum as defined in the 
Decision of 7 July 2021 authorising the use of lump sum contributions 
under the Horizon Europe Programme – the Framework Programme for 
Research and Innovation (2021 -2027) – and in actions under the 
Research and Training Programme of the European Atomic Energy 
Community (2021-2025) 270. 
 
Expected Outcome : Successful proposals should support the recovery, resilience, and EU 
integration of Ukraine’s forest sector, addressing the compounded impacts of climate change 
and Russia’s war of aggression. 
Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes: 
• Ukrainian decision-makers and policymakers gain access to robust scientific data, tools, 
and methodologies for developing and implementing evidence -based policies that are 
aligned with EU forest-related policies; 
• recovery, restoration, sustainable management and development of Ukraine’s war -
affected forests through improved governance, enhanced institutional capacity, and the 
implementation of sustainable forest management practices that address the impacts of 
climate change, biodiversity loss and Russian invasion; 
 
• strengthened Ukrainian forest research and education systems, providing a solid 
evidence basis for forestry policy development, supporting students and educators, and 
promoting innovation in forest science; 
• expanded national and international cooperation and the development of a national forest 
monitoring system, enabling knowledge exchange and global cooperation in sustainable 
forestry; 
• accelerated alignment of Ukraine’s forest governance, legislation, and technical 
standards with EU acquis communautaire, reinforcing its path toward EU accession and 
long-term convergence with European environmental (including biodiversity) and 
climate goals.  
Scope: To address the pressing challenges posed by climate change, biodiversity loss and 
Russia's war against Ukraine, significant advancements in forest science, education, and 
international collaboration are essential. The war has caused severe damage to Ukraine’s 
forests, exacerbated institutional and capacity issues in forestry governance and research and 
innovation, and highlighted the need for capacity building and knowledge exchange. Another 
key priority for the coming years will be the full digitalisation of Ukraine’s forest cadastre to 
establish a reliable, transparent, and accessible system for forest governance and scientific 
research. 
Proposals should develop innovative research, policy, and capacity -building actions that 
contribute to the post -war recovery and sustainable transformation of Ukraine’s forest sector. 
Proposals should explore diverse approaches and methods but should clearly address 
Ukraine’s unique context. Anticipated Ukrainian stakeholders to be involved include local 
and regional authorities, national ministries and public agencies, academic and research 
institutions, forest owners and managers, local communities, civil society organizations, 
NGOs, forest industry representatives, and educational institutions. The action under this 
topic is relevant to EU policies related to the recovery and sustainable management of forests, 
including the EU forest strategy for 2030, the EU biodiversity strategy for 2030, the European 
Green Deal, the EU climate adaptation strategy, and the Nature Restoration Regulation. 
Proposals should: 
• strengthen Ukrainian forest research systems and their integration into policy by 
expanding data collection, enhancing stakeholder engagement, and providing scientific 
support to equip decision -makers with evidence for policy development and 
implementation; 
• enhance international collaboration and forest science diplomacy in the context of 
Ukraine’s recovery, by building partnerships for sustainable forest management, support 
the digitalisation of Ukraine’s forest cadastre to enable transparent, accurate, and 
accessible forest data and establish a comprehensive, continuous forest monitoring 
system, aligned with EU and global policies; 
• strengthen Ukrainian institutional and governance capacity by improving frameworks 
and research institutions to ensure the long -term resilience and effectiveness of 
sustainable forest management practices; 
• promote innovation in Ukrainian forest education and training by modernizing curricula, 
supporting student mobility and international research collaboration, and developing 
lifelong learning programmes for forestry professionals; 
• contribute to the alignment of Ukrainian forestry -related legislation, inspection systems, 
and standards with EU legislation as a core component of the EU accession and 
integration process.
