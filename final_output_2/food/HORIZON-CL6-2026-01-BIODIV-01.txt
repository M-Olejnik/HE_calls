HORIZON-CL6-2026-01-BIODIV-01: Understanding and tackling the decline of insects 
Call: Call 01 - single stage (2026) 
Specific conditions 
Expected EU 
contribution per 
project 
The Commission estimates that an EU contribution of around EUR 6.50 
million would allow these outcomes to be addressed appropriately. 
Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of a 
proposal requesting different amounts. 
Indicative budget The total indicative budget for the topic is EUR 13.00 million. 
Type of Action Research and Innovation Actions 
 
Expected Outcome:   
Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes: 
• researchers better understand the status and population trends of insect species and the 
drivers of their decline; 
• competent authorities in charge of biodiversity policies at all levels are capable of taking 
informed decisions, based on better understanding and valuation of socioeconomic 
benefits and ecological importance of insects, including for climate action; 
• society and relevant land managers are better informed and equipped to tackle the 
drivers of the decline of insects.  
Scope: Insects play a vital role contributing to ecosystem functions in addition to pollination, 
such as decomposition and nutrient cycles, soil formation (including carbon sequestration) 
and pest control, control functions essential for maintaining ecosystem complexity, and are an 
indispensable part of the food chain. Those functions are key for climate change mitigation 
and allow the provision of ecosystem services which have economic benefits and support 
human well-being. Additionally, insects play a key role in other socioeconomic areas such as 
medical and pharmaceutical applications (e.g. antimicrobial peptides), forensic science or 
biotechnology. 
The dramatic decline of insects, estimated around 75% in the last three decades, is raising 
increasing concern among scientists and in the public, since it could have far -reaching 
implications. In order to be able to tackle this decline, there is a need to improve our 
understanding of the drivers of loss and how they interplay. A better knowledge of insects 
themselves is necessary. 
With targets 4 and 5 of the EU biodiversity strategy for 2030, the EU took, among others, the 
commitment that by 2030 habitats and species show no deterioration in conservation trend 
and status, at least 30% reach favourable conservation status or at least show a positive trend, 
and that the decline of pollinators is reversed. According to the EU Nature Restoration 
Regulation, Member States shall put in place appropriate and effective measures to improve 
pollinator diversity and reverse the decline of pollinators by 2030. This is reflected in target 4 
of the Kunming -Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework. The European Climate Law 
requires Member States to adopt and implement national adaptation strategies and plans in 
which they should promote Nature -based Solutions and ecosystem -based adaptation. These 
policies and legislations have reached the implementation stage in the EU and worldwide. 
Successful proposals are expected to: 
• improve understanding and identification of insects’ diversity, including through 
genomic approaches; 
• focus on less known insect groups. In particular a solid knowledge has already been 
generated regarding pollination and pollinating insects through past and ongoing 
projects, therefore they are not expected to be subject to new research under this topic; 
• assess the status and trends of insects and analyse multiple drivers affecting them, as 
well as the ecosystem services that insects provide, at different spatial scales. A 
comprehensive integrative taxonomy approach should be adopted, incorporating a 
multidisciplinary framework, including ecology and ecotoxicology, and integrating 
methods that address the diverse needs of insects across their entire lifecycle, ensuring 
the identification of essential habitat resources at each stage of development. To assess 
the status and trends of insects and the effectiveness of strategies, proposals should 
develop and test approaches for long -term monitoring schemes for insects, possibly 
building on existing national or EU biodiversity monitoring schemes and pilots 
developed by Biodiversa+; 
• devise, test and promote effective strategies to mitigate the major drivers of insects’ 
decline. Analyse the ecosystem functions underpinned by insects and undertake 
qualitative and quantitative valuation of ecosystem services emanating from those functions; 
• explore how to implement ecosystem protection and restoration practises and actions 
that are beneficial for insects.  
Concrete efforts should be made to ensure that the data produced in the context of the funded 
project is FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Re -usable), exploring workflows 
that can provide “FAIR -by-design” data, i.e., data that is FAIR from its generation. 
Possibilities offered by the European Open Science Cloud (EOSC) and by relevant European 
research infrastructures including the Catalogue of Life (COL), DiSSCo, LifeWatch ERIC, 
EMBRC, eLTER and MIRRI -ERIC89  to store and give access to research data could be 
considered where relevant. 
Proposals should foresee appropriate resources to ensure close cooperation with the EC 
Knowledge Centre for Biodiversity (KCBD) and its Science Service and with other projects 
that work on understanding drivers of biodiversity decline. 
International cooperation is encouraged.
