HORIZON-CL6-2027-02-CLIMATE-01: Governance, sustainable development and 
international politics of a future ice-free Arctic 
Call: Call 02 - single stage (2027) 
Specific conditions 
Expected EU 
contribution per 
project 
The Commission estimates that an EU contribution of around EUR 8.00 
million would allow these outcomes to be addressed appropriately. 
Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of a 
proposal requesting different amounts. 
Indicative budget The total indicative budget for the topic is EUR 16.00 million. 
Type of Action Research and Innovation Actions 
Eligibility 
conditions 
The conditions are described in General Annex B. The following 
exceptions apply: 
All international organisations are exceptionally eligible for funding. 
The Joint Research Centre (JRC) may participate as member of the 
consortium selected for funding as a beneficiary with zero funding, or as 
an associated partner. The JRC will not participate in the preparation and 
submission of the proposal - see General Annex B. 
If projects use satellite -based earth observation, positioning, navigation 
and/or related timing data and services, beneficiaries must make use of 
Copernicus and/or Galileo/EGNOS (other data and services may 
additionally be used). 
 
Expected Outcome: Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected 
outcomes: 
• improved knowledge of the processes, feedbacks and impacts of an ice -free Arctic, both 
locally/regionally and globally, including advanced research on newly emerging aspects 
of the future regime change in the Arctic. 
• enhanced observations and monitoring capabilities of Arctic changes including ocean, 
land, sea-ice and atmosphere processes and biodiversity in the Arctic, informing the key 
components covered by the topic, i.e. governance, sustainable development and 
international politics of an ice-free Arctic. 
• knowledge-based recommendations for sustainable development (of ocean -based and 
blue economy activities), environmental conservation, climate change adaptation and 
resilience, better-informed planning of resources (with a focus on coastal communities 
and activities) and enabled evidence -based regional, European, and global decision –
making on Arctic Ocean Governance; sustained European leadership in ocean –climate–
biodiversity-cryosphere science; significant contributions made to global scientific 
assessments, such as the IPCC, IPBES, SWIPA (Snow, Water, Ice and Permafrost in the 
Arctic) and WOA (World Ocean Assessments), as well as to the UN Decade of Ocean 
Science for Sustainable Development (2021 – 2030) and Decade of Action for 
Cryospheric Sciences (2025 -2034), Central Arctic Ocean Fisheries Agreement 
(CAOFA), the International Polar Year 2032 -2033, UN SDGs 13 and 14, and the 
European polar science coordination efforts.  
Scope: Proposals should: 
• better understand, project and reduce uncertainties linked to the impacts, timing and 
consequences of an ice-free Arctic. This includes the underlying systems (such as ocean, 
atmosphere, cryosphere, and biosphere) and processes, strengthening research on key or 
main drivers of internal variability and their interconnectedness to the climate system, 
under multi and cumulative and cascading impacts of anthropogenic activities (resource 
extraction, climate change, shipping and industrial activities, pollution, introduction of 
NIS, etc.), abrupt, irreversible change/tipping elements and thresholds, including their 
reversibility. In particular, understanding the nuances of the impacts of occasional daily 
ice-free conditions, versus frequent monthly ice -free conditions, versus ice -free 
conditions that occur for several months a year, is needed to assess the true impact of a 
new seasonal Arctic sea ice regime in a warming world, in particular in and for Europe. 
• enhance regional models representing integrated key physical, biogeochemical, and 
biological processes, especially to capture processes in the changing sea -ice regimes 
(ecological and political) and the impacts of extremes, building on and further 
developing the existing IPCC class climate models and making use of new technologies 
for sustained monitoring of key climate indicators / shared Arctic variables and machine 
learning techniques for the advanced interpretation of these data. 
• identify transformative pathways and key leverage points for sustainable mitigation and 
anticipatory adaptation approaches. This could include and are not limited to looking 
into aspects of: community resilience and health, particularly Indigenous populations, in 
adapting to cultural, political, economic and environmental changes, including 
addressing food security, health impacts, and preserving cultural practices; explore novel 
economic opportunities and challenges, evaluating the potential for shorter and new 
shipping routes and other economic opportunities, explore sustainable energy solutions 
for Arctic communities, including wind, solar, and geothermal energy potential, resource 
exploration, and sustainable economic development while ensuring environmental 
protection; explore elements of risk management and hazard mitigation preparing for 
increased coastal erosion, increased extreme weather events, and the impacts of thawing 
permafrost on infrastructures, greenhouse emissions, and increased risks of natural and 
anthropogenic hazards; develop strategies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and 
enhance carbon sequestration in Arctic ecosystems (bearing in mind the precautionary 
principle/approach, and the efficiency and effectiveness of Nature -based Solutions); 
improve projections for Arctic’s “Last Ice Area” (LIA) — a vital habitat for ice -
dependent species — and critical for Arctic habitats , and inform conservation policies 
and measures; explore the power of enhancing cooperation among Arctic nations and 
global partners to share data, resources, and expertise and identify issues of geopolitical 
and strategic nature and assess the implications of a navigable Arctic for shipping and 
other blue economy or coastal -linked activities, resource extraction, and international 
relations, strongly considering sustainability and the precautionary principle/approach.  
Actions should conduct trans - and multi -disciplinary research, include aspects of gender, 
SSH, equality and inclusion, and intergenerational concerns, and strengthen the inclusion of 
different knowledge systems (Indigenous Knowledge, Local Knowledge and Science) in 
broadening our understanding the multifaceted governance, sustainable development and 
international politics of an ice -free Arctic. International cooperation is strongly encouraged, 
especially with the All -Atlantic Ocean Research and Innovation Alliance (AAORIA) partner 
countries305. A strong linkage should be ensured with the ongoing activities under Polhavet 
2050 – Arctic Ocean 2050. The actions should build on existing observing platforms and 
initiatives, and/or contribute to the evolution of the EU Digital Twin of the Ocean and 
Destination Earth. All in -situ data collected through actions funded from this call should 
follow INSPIRE principles and be available through open access repositories supported by the 
European Commission (Copernicus and EMODnet). Concrete efforts should be made to 
ensure that the data produced in the context of the funded projects is FAIR (Findable, 
Accessible, Interoperable and Re-usable). 
This topic is part of a coordination initiative between ESA and the European Commission on 
Earth System Science and should towards this end include sufficient means and resources for 
effective coordination, with relevant ESA Polar Science Cluster projects, including utilising 
novel satellite Earth Observation datasets and joint research actions. Furthermore, this topic is 
supporting the European polar science coordination efforts, including synergies with the 
objectives of the European Polar Coordination Office (EPCO) and through contributing to the 
implementation of its work plan. Proposals are encouraged to consider, where relevant, the 
data, expertise and services offered by European research infrastructures 306, as well as related 
projects in the environment domain. 
The Joint Research Centre (JRC) may participate as member of the consortium selected for 
funding. The JRC may contribute with its expertise related to developing new methods to 
forecast air pollution and to estimate methane emissions from thawing permafrost.
