HORIZON-CL6-2026-01-CIRCBIO-04: Demonstrating and deploying innovative 
collection, sorting-for-reuse and repair systems for textiles at city/region level (Circular 
Cities and Regions Initiative topic) 
Call: Call 01 - single stage (2026) 
Specific conditions 
Expected EU 
contribution per 
project 
The Commission estimates that an EU contribution of around EUR 5.00 
million would allow these outcomes to be addressed appropriately. 
Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of a 
proposal requesting different amounts. 
Indicative budget The total indicative budget for the topic is EUR 10.00 million. 
Type of Action Innovation Actions 
Eligibility 
conditions 
The conditions are described in General Annex B. The following 
exceptions apply: 
The following additional eligibility criteria apply: the proposals must 
apply the multi -actor approach. See definition of the multi -actor 
approach in this work programme part. 
The following additional eligibility criteria apply: at least nine (9) 
distinct regional or local authorities must be part of the consortium as 
beneficiaries, among which at least three (3) from different 
demonstration cities/regions and another six (6) from other and different 
replication cities/regions. 
Technology 
Readiness Level 
Activities are expected to achieve TRL 6 -8 by the end of the project – 
see General Annex B. Activities may start at any TRL. 
Legal and financial 
set-up of the Grant 
Agreements 
The rules are described in General Annex G. The following exceptions 
apply: 
Eligible costs will take the form of a lump sum as defined in the 
Decision of 7 July 2021 authorising the use of lump sum contributions 
under the Horizon Europe Programme – the Framework Programme for 
Research and Innovation (2021 -2027) – and in actions under the 
Research and Training Programme of the European Atomic Energy 
Community (2021-2025) 230. 
 
Expected Outcome: Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected 
outcomes: 
 
• local/regional authorities and their operators adopt optimised collection and sorting 
systems of municipal waste that prioritise textile reuse and repair; 
• social economy entities and society at large benefit from favourable conditions for reuse 
and repair practices which enable product lifetime prolongation and stimulate second -
hand markets; 
• citizens have access to better information, leading to greater awareness and public 
acceptance, and stimulating behavioural change towards sustainable consumption; 
• innovative circular textile methodologies, practices and solutions are made available to 
enable large-scale replication and upscaling in European cities and regions; 
• businesses are stimulated to advance repair strategies and circular business models while 
creating new jobs.  
Scope: This topic supports the implementation of the European Commission’s Circular Cities 
and Regions Initiative  (CCRI). It is part of a series of CCRI -related topics funded under 
Horizon Europe with the aim of accelerating place -based innovation, boosting skills and 
capacities as well as supporting the implementation of solutions for a circular systemic 
transition at city/region level. The implementation of circular systemic solutions reduces 
environmental impacts and contribute to the preservation of biodiversity, by decreasing the 
extraction of primary raw materials and minimizing waste generation. 
Proposals should: 
• develop, test and validate innovative solutions that accelerate the adoption of textile 
reuse and repair practices by local/regional authorities and their operators (e.g. public 
collection points, retailer take-back schemes); 
• involve citizens, local (e.g. upcycling) businesses and social enterprises in the 
development and implementation of local repair & reuse strategies and practices; 
• improve data captured on local textile waste flows and ensure transparency and 
traceability across the supply chain; 
• develop solutions for sorting, and preparing for re -use, including digital solutions (in 
view of the implementation of digital product passport) and AI to enable repair and 
affordable pricing of repaired clothes and to stimulate reuse of textiles, particularly 
apparels; 
• incentivise manufacturers to provide spare parts to enhance reuse and reparability (e.g. 
linen for a coat, extra buttons, zippers, etc.) and to provide extended guarantee. 
• develop actionable recommendations for replication in other European cities and 
regions.  
Proposals must use the multi -actor approach and take into account a gender sensitive and 
inclusive approach. Collaboration between retailers/manufacturers and small repair business 
and social enterprises is encouraged. 
Proposals should seek to contribute to the goals and cooperate with the services of the 
European Commission’s Circular Cities and Regions Initiative (CCRI) and in particular with 
the CCRI Coordination and Support Office. Joint activities with other CCRI -related projects 
and clustering with other related projects is strongly encouraged. 
Proposals should also evaluate the feasibility, effectiveness and impact of the demonstrated 
solutions using robust evaluation methods (including lifecycle assessments such as product 
environmental footprint, where relevant) and present data and evidence about the economic, 
environmental and social costs and benefits of the developed solutions. 
The topic requires the effective contribution of SSH disciplines and the involvement of SSH 
experts, institutions as well as the inclusion of relevant SSH expertise, in order to produce 
meaningful and significant effects enhancing the societal impact of the related research 
activities. 
The topic supports the European Green Deal, the Ecodesign for Sustainable Products 
Regulation and its working plan, the upcoming Circular Economy Act and contributes to 
Europe’s efforts to develop a single market for sustainable products. It also contributes to the 
Start-ups and Scale -ups strategy through deep structural transformations and place -based 
innovation and it is in line with the Waste Framework Directive and EPR for textiles.
