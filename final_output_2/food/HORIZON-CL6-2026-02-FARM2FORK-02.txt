detection, management strategies, and foresight 
Call: Call 02 - single stage (2026) 
Specific conditions 
Expected EU 
contribution per 
project 
The Commission estimates that an EU contribution of around EUR 6.00 
million would allow these outcomes to be addressed appropriately. 
Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of a 
proposal requesting different amounts. 
Indicative budget The total indicative budget for the topic is EUR 12.00 million. 
Type of Action Research and Innovation Actions 
Eligibility 
conditions 
The conditions are described in General Annex B. The following 
exceptions apply: 
The following additional eligibility criteria apply: the proposals must 
apply the multi -actor approach. See definition of the multi -actor 
approach in this work programme part. 
Legal and financial 
set-up of the Grant 
Agreements 
The rules are described in General Annex G. The following exceptions 
apply: 
Eligible costs will take the form of a lump sum as defined in the 
Decision of 7 July 2021 authorising the use of lump sum contributions 
under the Horizon Europe Programme – the Framework Programme for 
Research and Innovation (2021 -2027) – and in actions under the 
Research and Training Programme of the European Atomic Energy 
Community (2021-2025) 143. 
 
Expected Outcome: Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected 
outcomes: 
 
• a holistic and science -based approach to tackling pesticide resistance is developed, 
providing actionable recommendations to improve crop protection strategies and support 
evidence-based decision-making at all levels; 
• farmers, advisors, and practitioners are empowered with knowledge, tools, and 
integrated strategies —including innovative environmentally friendly and sustainable 
alternatives that promote agrobiodiversity —supported by data -driven approaches and 
robust monitoring systems; 
• foresight capacities are enhanced, enabling the anticipation of resistance trends and 
supporting long -term planning to strengthen the resilience and sustainability of 
agricultural systems.  
Scope: Agriculture and forestry face a growing challenge from the dual threat of a shrinking 
portfolio of active substances and increasing pests 144 resistance to treatments. Climate change 
compounds this issue by enabling pests to survive milder winters, expand their ranges, and 
increase their exposure to pesticides —accelerating the development of resistance. Addressing 
this complex issue requires a comprehensive, science -based systemic approach that integrates 
early detection, adaptive management, and long -term foresight to reduce resistance risks and 
strengthen the sustainability and resilience of agriculture and forestry. It is also relevant to 
acknowledge that while pesticides are important short -term solutions, the long -term solutions 
require shifts in current agriculture or forestry practices and system -level transformations 
within agri -food systems that would boost the resilience of these production environments, 
while preserving biodiversity. 
Proposals should: 
• map resistance risks by assessing the current and projected emergence of pest resistance, 
considering the declining number of available active substances 145 and the authorised 
products for different crops; 
• develop early detection methods and predictive modelling (including AI -driven 
approaches) to anticipate and monitor the evolution of pesticide resistance, integrating 
advanced measurements tools and risk assessment methodologies, notably when 
products are used at farm level; 
• design and evaluate innovative integrated pest and weed management (IPWM) strategies 
that reduce resistance risks by expanding non -chemical preventive and curative options, 
optimising the rotation and combination of (agroecological) farming practices, and 
applying advanced technologies for precise and targeted pesticide use, while capitalising 
on the results of previous and ongoing initiatives; 
 
• innovate storage and handling practices to reduce resistance pressure during post -harvest 
stages; 
• support foresight activities to anticipate, mitigate and prevent resistance impacts by 
exploring interactions among technological, environmental, and socio -economic drivers, 
assessing planned resistance -management strategies against various future scenarios, 
establishing long -term resistance monitoring, and integrating foresight outputs into 
decision-making and adaptive management through collaboration across research, 
farming and forestry sectors, industry, stakeholder networks, and policymakers; 
• enhance capacity -building, stakeholder engagement and communication through 
awareness-raising, sensitisation, education, and the co -creation of solutions with end -
users.  
Proposals must implement the multi -actor approach including a range of actors to ensure that 
knowledge and needs from various sectors are brought together. 
Proposals should capitalise on relevant research findings, knowledge, solutions and tools, 
from past and ongoing projects and collaborate with ongoing initiatives. In addition, proposals 
should consider the activities of international committees on pesticide resistance management. 
The projects under this topic are relevant to the EU policies related to the objectives of the 
common agricultural policy, the Sustainable Use of Pesticides Directive 146, and align with the 
Vision for Agriculture and Food, and support the Commission Communication on: Building 
the future with nature: Boosting Biotechnology and Biomanufacturing in the EU147.
