HORIZON-CL6-2027-02-CLIMATE-03: Carbon farming innovation and scale-up 
Call: Call 02 - single stage (2027) 
Specific conditions 
Expected EU 
contribution per 
project 
The Commission estimates that an EU contribution of around EUR 6.00 
million would allow these outcomes to be addressed appropriately. 
Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of a 
 
proposal requesting different amounts. 
Indicative budget The total indicative budget for the topic is EUR 12.00 million. 
Type of Action Research and Innovation Actions 
Eligibility 
conditions 
The conditions are described in General Annex B. The following 
exceptions apply: 
The following additional eligibility criteria apply: the proposals must 
apply the multi -actor approach. See definition of the multi -actor 
approach in this work programme part. 
If projects use satellite -based earth observation, positioning, navigation 
and/or related timing data and services, beneficiaries must make use of 
Copernicus and/or Galileo/EGNOS (other data and services may 
additionally be used). 
Technology 
Readiness Level 
Activities are expected to achieve TRL 5 by the end of the project – see 
General Annex B. 
Legal and 
financial set-up of 
the Grant 
Agreements 
The rules are described in General Annex G. The following exceptions 
apply: 
Eligible costs will take the form of a lump sum as defined in the 
Decision of 7 July 2021 authorising the use of lump sum contributions 
under the Horizon Europe Programme – the Framework Programme for 
Research and Innovation (2021 -2027) – and in actions under the 
Research and Training Programme of the European Atomic Energy 
Community (2021-2025) 311. 
 
Expected Outcome: Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected 
outcomes: 
• models, methods and data needed for the quantification of carbon farming activities and 
results are available for integration in a single monitoring, reporting and verification 
(MRV) system, so that the costs and burden associated to carbon farming MRV are 
reduced to a minimum; 
• use of carbon-removal and emission-reduction certification is facilitated at scale, and the 
EU Carbon Removals and Carbon Farming (CRCF) Regulation 312 becomes the basis for 
cost-effective certification of carbon farming in different contexts; 
 
• carbon farming actors involved in CRCF implementation in different roles – including 
land managers and other market participants as well as certification and governance 
bodies – have access to relevant scientific knowledge and tailored technical support for 
the implementation of CRCF rules.  
Scope: The CRCF Regulation creates the first EU -wide voluntary framework for certifying 
carbon removals, carbon farming and carbon storage in products across Europe. By 
establishing EU quality criteria and laying down monitoring and reporting processes, the 
CRCF Regulation will facilitate investment in innovative carbon removal technologies, as 
well as sustainable carbon farming solutions, while addressing greenwashing. By 2026, the 
Commission will have adopted the first EU certification methodologies for different carbon 
farming activities through delegated acts, will have issued implementing acts with 
certification rules, and will have started the process of recognising certification schemes 
entitled to apply CRCF rules. With implementation of CRCF expected to start in 2027, this 
topic should serve to develop innovations and knowledge facilitating and enhancing its 
implementation on the ground. 
Proposals should: 
• develop innovations to facilitate carbon farming certification, particularly by integrating 
advanced technologies (e.g., machine learning, artificial intelligence, blockchain, Earth 
observation, IoT) and by enhancing cooperation among holders of relevant knowledge 
and data (e.g., networks of benchmark sites, ring tests among soil laboratories, 
interoperability of relevant datasets), in order to harmonise data collection and 
verification and to minimise administrative burden for operators; 
• maintain open -access lists of models, sampling protocols, datasets of emission factors 
and other relevant data to harmonise sustainability benchmarks for carbon farming 
activities, enhance the robustness of company -level and national greenhouse gas 
inventories for the land sector and the agricultural sector, and ensure the comparability 
and interoperability of all CRCF uses; 
• based on experience with the implementation of the CRCF Regulation and its 
implementing rules during the first years after entry into force, and building on previous 
knowledge and tools developed by other relevant (EU -funded) projects, enhance 
capacity among the relevant stakeholders and facilitate the broad application of new or 
improved technologies, processes or services supporting the successful participation of 
land managers, certification schemes, and certification bodies; 
• create awareness about CRCF among all potential users, buyers, or financiers of carbon 
farming (e.g., companies in the bioeconomy, national and regional agriculture and 
environmental authorities, financial institutions), collect information about their data 
needs, and facilitate access to those data within the context of CRCF certification and
registry;  
• systematically collect and analyse feedback and lessons learned by carbon farming 
actors involved in CRCF implementation, particularly regarding obstacles to 
implementing and scaling-up of CRCF certification; 
• identify and address – through technological, economic or social innovations – 
remaining obstacles for effective large -scale participation in CRCF certification, and 
propose potential improvements to enabling conditions, certification methodologies, 
verification rules, and incentive structures.  
Proposals must implement the multi -actor approach and ensure adequate involvement of 
relevant stakeholders, including potential carbon -farming practitioners (farmers, foresters and 
other land managers), other market participants, certification bodies and relevant public 
authorities. 
Proposals should include a dedicated task, appropriate resources and a plan on how they will 
collaborate with the other project(s) selected under this topic and with projects under other 
relevant topics in Horizon Europe Work Programmes, including the Mission 'A Soil Deal for 
Europe' and the EU Soil Observatory (EUSO). 
In this topic the integration of the gender dimension (sex and gender analysis) in research and 
innovation content is not a mandatory requirement.
