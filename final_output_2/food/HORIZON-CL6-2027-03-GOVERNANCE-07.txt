HORIZON-CL6-2027-03-GOVERNANCE-07: Strengthening strategic advice and 
synergies between EU and national Research and Innovation agendas and investments 
Call: Call 03 - single stage (2027) 
Specific conditions 
Expected EU 
contribution per 
project 
The Commission estimates that an EU contribution of around EUR 4.75 
million would allow these outcomes to be addressed appropriately. 
Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of a 
proposal requesting different amounts. 
Indicative budget The total indicative budget for the topic is EUR 4.75 million. 
Type of Action Coordination and Support Actions 
Legal and financial 
set-up of the Grant 
Agreements 
The rules are described in General Annex G. The following exceptions 
apply: 
Eligible costs will take the form of a lump sum as defined in the 
Decision of 7 July 2021 authorising the use of lump sum contributions 
under the Horizon Europe Programme – the Framework Programme for 
Research and Innovation (2021 -2027) – and in actions under the 
Research and Training Programme of the European Atomic Energy 
Community (2021-2025) 372. 
 
Expected Outcome: Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected 
outcomes: 
 
• strengthened coordination between European and national research and innovation 
programmes and agendas in the areas of the Standing Committee on Agricultural 
Research (SCAR) Working Groups (WGs), resulting in a reinforced European Research 
Area (ERA); 
• improved impact and visibility of the SCAR WGs through organisation, facilitation and 
reporting of SCAR WGs activities on the various themes of main relevance for European 
R&I activities and relevant policy initiatives, leading to enhanced R&I cooperation and 
information exchange between Member States and Associated Countries and synergies 
at national and EU level; 
• SCAR WGs are supported in delivering their objectives as outlined in their mandates by 
various measures including through capacity building and support for SCAR WG cross -
collaboration and inclusiveness; 
• broad dissemination of the outputs of the SCAR WGs to relevant stakeholders, such as 
EU level and national policy makers, the research community and practitioners, which 
should also be available to the SCAR Steering Group and Plenary.  
Scope: The successful proposal should contribute to relevant R&I priorities in the thematic 
areas of the SCAR, in agriculture, fisheries, food systems, forestry, and the wider 
bioeconomy, as well as foresight. It should contribute to the European Green Deal priorities, 
the implementation of the new EU Bioeconomy Strategy, the objectives of the Vision for 
Agriculture and Food, the EU Forest Strategy, and other relevant upcoming initiatives and 
policies. 
Proposals should: 
• support the administrative and logistic organisation, the facilitation, and the reporting of 
the meetings and workshops of SCAR WGs, according to the needs and initiatives taken 
by the groups themselves; 
• support the thematic work of the groups by preparing relevant analyses and outputs 
adapted to their needs (e.g., portfolio analysis, policy briefs, research studies etc.); 
• encourage and facilitate cross -collaboration across SCAR WGs and support 
collaboration, information exchange and synergies with other EU -level R&I initiatives, 
such as partnerships, missions, and relevant projects, as well as support on interactions 
with relevant stakeholders and practitioners; 
• allow for sufficient flexibility to support SCAR WGs groups based on their needs, and to 
balance support across WGs; 
• use innovative and where applicable digital tools and methods for supporting SCAR 
WGs in all its domains.
