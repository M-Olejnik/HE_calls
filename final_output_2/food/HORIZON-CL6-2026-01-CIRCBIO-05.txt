HORIZON-CL6-2026-01-CIRCBIO-05: Understanding biomass flows in Europe 
Call: Call 01 - single stage (2026) 
Specific conditions 
Expected EU 
contribution per 
project 
The Commission estimates that an EU contribution of around EUR 3.00 
million would allow these outcomes to be addressed appropriately. 
Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of a 
proposal requesting different amounts. 
Indicative budget The total indicative budget for the topic is EUR 6.00 million. 
Type of Action Research and Innovation Actions 
Eligibility 
conditions 
The conditions are described in General Annex B. The following 
exceptions apply: 
The Joint Research Centre (JRC) may participate as member of the 
consortium selected for funding as a beneficiary with zero funding, or as 
an associated partner. The JRC will not participate in the preparation 
and submission of the proposal - see General Annex B. 
If projects use satellite -based earth observation, positioning, navigation 
and/or related timing data and services, beneficiaries must make use of 
Copernicus and/or Galileo/EGNOS (other data and services may 
additionally be used). 
Legal and 
financial set-up of 
the Grant 
Agreements 
The rules are described in General Annex G. The following exceptions 
apply: 
Eligible costs will take the form of a lump sum as defined in the 
Decision of 7 July 2021 authorising the use of lump sum contributions 
under the Horizon Europe Programme – the Framework Programme for 
Research and Innovation (2021 -2027) – and in actions under the 
Research and Training Programme of the European Atomic Energy 
Community (2021-2025) 231. 
 
Expected Outcome: Project results are expected to contribute to all the following expected 
outcomes:   
• enhanced understanding of the environmental, social and economic potential of the 
supply of different biomass types (from local to international perspectives), as well as its 
sustainability implications, including biodiversity and (air, water and soil) pollution, 
synergies and tensions; 
• enhanced capacity of private and public stakeholders to increase resource efficiency in 
utilising primary and secondary biomass as well as biomass processing and use, 
including through digital tools which may involve artificial intelligence and remote 
sensing, and roadmaps towards sustainable biomass management; without undermining 
food security; 
• enhanced support to businesses and administrations that optimise biomass supply, 
processing, and use, such that ecosystems and biodiversity are protected and restored, 
emissions of greenhouse gases and pollutants reduced, and human needs for biomass 
satisfied in sufficient and fair way.   
Scope: There is a need to better understand the production and use of biomass, a limited 
resource, in its various types. Bioeconomy, and biomass as its essential feedstock, provides 
solutions on various dimensions (environmental, social and economic). However, there are 
biomass-related challenges to overcome: the EU forest carbon sink is below the target and 
 
declining in most countries and the need to restore ecosystems and halt biodiversity loss 232. 
This implies that biomass supply is partly unsustainable. Simultaneously, companies see 
themselves challenged to satisfy the growing demand for biomass in the future. There are 
solutions to increase the sustainable production, including to reduce pollutants, and adjust the 
demand: e.g. better valorise unused or under -exploited sustainable biomass and degraded 
land, apply new breeding techniques and increase resource efficiency through circular design, 
new business models, consumption, recycling or repair. 
There is a need to better understand where biomass valorisation can be improved, to ensure 
local or regional added value increases and to drive innovative and competitive business 
solutions. For an optimal biomass production and effective use, matching supply and demand 
in the local or regional context, a better and more robust understanding of actual biomass 
flows is a fundamental prerequisite. 
Proposals should address all the following activities: 
• Improve and develop innovative, administration -light biomass monitoring and 
modelling/assessment methods and digital tools at European level (regional, national, 
and continental scale) to optimise biomass flows, paying particular attention to areas 
with untapped (sustainable) biomass resources, in close cooperation with stakeholders. 
• Provide an updated estimate of biomass supply and demand today and projected until 
2050 at national and EU level, including associated countries, considering the quality of 
biomass, their potential use, the sustainability and risks (e.g. spread of pathogens) of 
supplied biomass, as well as potential non -satisfied (non-)industrial demand due to the 
limitation of availability of sustainable biomass. The 2050 outlook should be 
accompanied by scenarios on EU’s future bioresources regarding supply and demand. 
• Test and demonstrate, in cooperation with stakeholders, the feasibility of biomass 
reporting in test regions of at least 10 countries across Europe with different potential of 
biomass supply.  
The European Commission’s Joint Research Centre (JRC) may participate as member of the 
consortium selected for funding since the monitoring and assessment tools developed may 
contribute to the EU level assessment of biomass flows of the Knowledge Centre for 
Bioeconomy. 
Proposals are encouraged to work together with additional relevant initiatives including those 
of the Circular Biobased Europe Joint Undertaking, the European Circular Economy 
Stakeholder Platform, the BIOEAST Initiative; build on results from projects such as 
BIO2REG, CONCERTO, NextGenCarbon; as well as considering the topic ‘HORIZON-CL6-
2027-01-CIRCBIO-08: Improving biomass flows for a sustainable and circular bioeconomy’. 
 
Proposals are encouraged to consider, where relevant, the data, expertise and services offered 
by the European research infrastructure in the environment, biological and food domains. 
The topic is relevant to the EU policies related to the European Commission’s communication 
on: Building the future with nature: Boosting Biotechnology and Biomanufacturing in the EU; 
the Competitiveness Compass and the Clean Industrial Deal; the Vision for Agriculture and 
Food; the new EU bioeconomy strategy, the Life Sciences Strategy, the EU Biotech Act and 
the Circular Economy Act.
