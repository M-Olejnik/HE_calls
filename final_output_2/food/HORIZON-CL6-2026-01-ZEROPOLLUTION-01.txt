HORIZON-CL6-2026-01-ZEROPOLLUTION-01: Toward a comprehensive assessment 
of the disturbance of marine ecosystems by anthropogenic underwater noise 
Call: Call 01 - single stage (2026) 
Specific conditions 
Expected EU 
contribution per 
project 
The Commission estimates that an EU contribution of around EUR 
10.00 million would allow these outcomes to be addressed appropriately. 
Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of a 
proposal requesting different amounts. 
Indicative budget The total indicative budget for the topic is EUR 10.00 million. 
Type of Action Research and Innovation Actions 
 
 
Expected Outcome: Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected 
outcomes: 
• impacts of continuous and impulsive underwater noise levels on marine organisms and 
ecosystems, and the related ecosystem services they provide, including cumulative 
impacts with other pressures, are well understood, taking into account regional 
differences; 
• environmental authorities have access to advanced methods, tools and indicators 
enabling them to comprehensively monitor and assess the impacts of underwater noise 
pollution on marine species and ecosystems and to devise strategies for protecting the 
ecosystems services they provide.  
Scope: Proposals should: 
• develop new, or improve upon existing, scientific methods and tools for 
comprehensively monitoring the impacts of anthropogenic underwater noise pollution on 
marine ecosystems and species populations at different trophic levels and taking into 
account regional differences; 
• develop new, or improve upon existing, indicators for the assessment of the effects of 
noise exposure as well as their cumulative effects on marine organisms and ecosystems, 
and the services they provide, in line with methods (including threshold values) already 
agreed at EU level for the assessment of good environmental status for underwater noise 
and taking into account regional developments; 
• investigate options for mitigation measures for safeguarding relevant ecosystem services, 
including carbon sequestration, and develop or improve tools to measure their impacts 
and efficiency.  
Proposals should support the objective and implementation of the Marine Strategy Framework 
Directive (MSFD) by providing new evidence and data on the impacts of noise on marine 
ecosystems and related ecosystem services, in line with the MSFD guidelines for impulsive 
and continuous noise monitoring, and by providing evidence -based methods for the 
assessment of good environmental status for underwater noise at national, regional and EU 
level. 
The European Commission signed on behalf of the European Union a Declaration for a High -
Ambition Coalition for a Quiet Ocean at UNOC 3 which includes actions to address 
underwater noise and mitigate its impact on marine life and biodiversity. With a view of 
supporting the implementation of this Declaration, proposals are expected to contribute to 
restore a quieter ocean.
