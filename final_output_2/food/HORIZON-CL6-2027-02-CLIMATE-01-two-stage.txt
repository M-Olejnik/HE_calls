Admissibility 
conditions 
The conditions are described in General Annex A. The following 
exceptions apply: 
Applicants submitting a proposal for a blind evaluation (see General 
Annex F) must not disclose their organisation names, acronyms, logos 
nor names of personnel in the proposal abstract and Part B of their first-
stage application (see General Annex E). 
Eligibility 
conditions 
The conditions are described in General Annex B. The following 
exceptions apply: 
If projects use satellite -based earth observation, positioning, navigation 
and/or related timing data and services, beneficiaries must make use of 
Copernicus and/or Galileo/EGNOS (other data and services may 
additionally be used). 
The Joint Research Centre (JRC) may participate as member of the 
consortium selected for funding as a beneficiary with zero funding, or 
as an associated partner. The JRC will not participate in the preparation 
and submission of the proposal - see General Annex B. 
The following additional eligibility criteria apply: the proposals must 
apply the multi -actor approach. See definition of the multi -actor 
approach in this work programme part. 
Procedure The procedure is described in General Annex F. The following 
exceptions apply: 
The first-stage proposals of this topic will be evaluated blindly. 
Legal and financial 
set-up of the Grant 
Agreements 
The rules are described in General Annex G. The following exceptions 
apply: 
Eligible costs will take the form of a lump sum as defined in the 
Decision of 7 July 2021 authorising the use of lump sum contributions 
under the Horizon Europe Programme – the Framework Programme for 
Research and Innovation (2021 -2027) – and in actions under the 
Research and Training Programme of the European Atomic Energy 
Community (2021-2025) 316. 
 
Expected Outcome: Project results are expected to contribute to one or more of the following 
expected outcomes corresponding to the European Water Resilience Strategy objectives: 
• the water cycle is restored; 
• the economy is following a water-smart path and the EU water industry is competitive; 
• water is clean and affordable for all.  
Scope: The European Commission adopted the European Water Resilience Strategy317, which 
proposes actions to address the expected outcomes described in this Open Topic. With a view 
of contributing with breakthrough innovation to this strategy, proposals are expected to 
address creative or disruptive solutions to develop a set of means for its implementation. 
Adapted to the nature, scope and type of proposed activities, proposals should convincingly 
explain how they will plan and/or carry out demonstration, testing or validation of developed 
tools and solutions. Proposals must implement the multi -actor approach and ensure adequate 
involvement of appropriate stakeholders, including where relevant farmers, water intensive 
industries, energy producers, land managers, water governance bodies and local authorities. 
Proposals should also delineate the plans to develop possible future uptake and upscaling at 
local, national and EU level for possible next steps after the project. In this topic the 
integration of the gender and intersectional dimension (sex and gender analysis) in research 
and innovation content should be addressed only if relevant in relation to the objectives of the 
research effort. Proposals should consider and possibly expand on previous research of related 
past national or EU-funded projects, avoiding duplication. 
Proposals should address one or more of the following actions: 
Restore the Water Cycle 
• uptake of innovative solutions to help retain water in natural ecosystems at regional 
level, including groundwater, to restore free flowing and renaturalising river shapes, to 
 
promote water-efficient practices and optimised soil-water interactions, to implement the 
source-to-sea approach and supporting biodiversity; 
• increase preparedness against water scarcity, droughts and floods, and integrate global 
change adaptation strategies, including climate -resilient water infrastructure, early 
warning systems, and risk assessments to enhance the resilience of water systems to 
future climate impacts; 
• improve hydrological and ecological monitoring to better assess the impacts of various 
water resources management actions and interventions, while facilitating cross -border 
collaboration and open access to data.  
Water smart economies 
• in line with the water efficiency first principle, identify techniques or methodologies and 
their advantages and develop indicators for water efficiency in various water consuming 
sectors, e.g. agriculture; 
• develop and propose water pricing systems and certification systems that rewards 
sustainable land management practices and that promote the efficient provision of water 
services and the efficient use of water; 
• propose a set of innovative technological and digital solutions for the water (services) 
sector and water user sectors, to promote a water -smart economy and to implement the 
water efficiency first principle; 
• develop and upscale innovative water reuse and recycling solutions, including potable 
applications where appropriate, contributing to circular water use.  
Ensuring clean and affordable water for all  
• analyse the barriers that prevent public participation and engagement and developing 
actions to increase public awareness and engagement in drinking water resource 
protection and river basin management plans; 
• develop cost effective measures to ensure equitable access to affordable water and 
sanitation for groups in vulnerable situations such as women, children, elder people, 
low-income communities, indigenous peoples, or persons with disabilities LGBTIQ 
people, people with a racial or religious minority background; 
• develop methodologies to improve the influence of water footprint over consumption 
processes/patterns.  
Proposals covering more than one action are not required to make links between the different 
actions if there is not. However, they should convincingly explain how their proposed actions 
are expected to contribute to the achievement of the expected outcomes they address. 
Proposals should leverage relevant Copernicus elements and foster complementarities, 
avoiding overlaps with projects funded under previous Framework Programmes, the 
Partnership Water Security for the Planet (Water4All), the EU Missions 'Restore our Ocean 
and Waters by 2030', 'Adaptation to Climate Change' and 'A Soil Deal for Europe'. Proposals 
should include a task to ensure collaboration with the other projects funded under this topic. It 
should reinforce the complementarities of approaches and methodologies developed and 
maximise the outcome of the topic for the different actions foreseen. 
JRC can support the awarded consortium with its expertise and work on current, emerging, 
and future risks associated with water -related extremes such as droughts and floods, and with 
its efforts to enhance the drought and flood components of the Copernicus Emergency 
Management Service.
