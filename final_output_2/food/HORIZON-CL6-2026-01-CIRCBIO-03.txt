HORIZON-CL6-2026-01-CIRCBIO-03: Advanced recovery of critical raw materials 
from Waste from Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) 
Call: Call 01 - single stage (2026) 
Specific conditions 
Expected EU 
contribution per 
project 
The Commission estimates that an EU contribution of around EUR 5.00 
million would allow these outcomes to be addressed appropriately. 
Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of a 
proposal requesting different amounts. 
Indicative budget The total indicative budget for the topic is EUR 10.00 million. 
Type of Action Research and Innovation Actions 
Technology 
Readiness Level 
Activities are expected to achieve TRL 4 -5 by the end of the project – 
see General Annex B. Activities may start at any TRL. 
Legal and financial 
set-up of the Grant 
Agreements 
The rules are described in General Annex G. The following exceptions 
apply: 
Eligible costs will take the form of a lump sum as defined in the 
Decision of 7 July 2021 authorising the use of lump sum contributions 
under the Horizon Europe Programme – the Framework Programme for 
Research and Innovation (2021 -2027) – and in actions under the 
Research and Training Programme of the European Atomic Energy 
Community (2021-2025) 229. 
 
Expected Outcome: Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected 
outcomes: 
• improved collection, sorting and recycling technologies that enhance significantly the 
recovery rates of strategic and critical raw materials from waste from electrical and 
electronic equipment, reducing the dependence on imported secondary and primary 
materials, and mitigating the climate and environmental impacts associated with their 
extraction, including biodiversity loss, by reducing the need for primary raw material 
extraction and minimising waste; 
 
• strengthened waste market creation through the development of economically viable and 
environmentally sound recovery and recycling practices and technologies, with a 
particular emphasis on secondary strategic raw materials of lower costs and sufficiently 
high quality and/or purity, promoting a circular economy for electrical and electronic 
equipment.  
Scope: As Europe seeks to reduce its dependence on imported critical raw materials and 
mitigate climate and environmental impacts from extraction, there is a pressing need for 
innovative and economically viable recycling processes. With the rapid increase in electronic 
waste, improving recycling technologies is essential to support the EU's transition to a circular 
economy. The topic addresses an urgent need to enhance the recovery and recycling of critical 
raw materials (CRMs) from Waste from Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) due to 
the increasing global demand for these materials, which are essential for various high -tech 
and green technologies. 
Proposals should: 
• develop new and/or improve existing scalable processes and technologies (including AI, 
where relevant, and exploring innovative recovery and recycling methods – possibly bio-
based, bio -inspired, or other breakthrough technologies) to efficiently collect, sort, 
recover and recycle strategic and critical raw materials including single components 
from electrical and electronic equipment waste, such as rare earth elements, precious 
metals and other valuable materials vital for the green and digital transitions, as well as 
possibly for EU aerospace and defence; 
• develop standards, technologies and processes, that demonstrate how to ensure the 
quality, cost and safety of recycled strategic and critical raw materials for the creation of 
an economically viable and sustainable waste market, thus reducing the environmental 
footprint of such processes, supporting biodiversity preservation and sustainable 
consumption, optimising the efficiency and effectiveness, including by improved 
automatisation and synergies of recovering multiple CRMs, bringing down costs and 
time while ensuring that EU’s secondary raw materials can be competitive against 
imported primary and secondary materials.  
The topic supports EU policies, particularly the European Green Deal, the EU Circular 
Economy Act, the Clean Industrial Deal, the Critical Raw Materials Act, the Waste from 
Electrical and Electronic Waste Directive, the Ecodesign for Sustainable Products Regulation 
(ESPR) and Europe’s efforts to develop a single market for sustainable products. Synergies 
with Cluster 4, the European Partnership on Raw Materials and ongoing Cluster 6 projects are 
encouraged.
