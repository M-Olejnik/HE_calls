HORIZON-CL5-2027-07-D3-25: Advanced TSO control rooms to enhance grid 
observability, stability and resilience 
Call: ENERGY 
Specific conditions 
Expected EU 
contribution per 
project 
The Commission estimates that an EU contribution of around EUR 9.50 
million would allow these outcomes to be addressed appropriately. 
Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of a proposal 
requesting different amounts. 
Indicative 
budget 
The total indicative budget for the topic is EUR 28.50 million. 
Type of Action Innovation Actions 
Eligibility 
conditions 
The conditions are described in General Annex B. The following 
exceptions apply: 
If projects use satellite-based earth observation, positioning, navigation 
and/or related timing data and services, beneficiaries must make use of 
Copernicus and/or Galileo/EGNOS (other data and services may 
additionally be used). 
In line with the “ restriction on control in innovation actions in critical 
technology areas” delineated in General Annex B of the General Annexes, 
entities established in an eligible country but which are directly or 
indirectly controlled by China or by a legal entity established in China are 
not eligible to participate in the action. 
Subject to restrictions for the protection of European communication 
networks. 
 
Technology 
Readiness Level 
Activities are expected to achieve TRL 6 -8 by the end of the project – see 
General Annex B. Activities may start at any TRL. 
 
Expected Outcome: Project results are expected to contribute to all the following expected 
outcomes: 
• Enhanced reliability, resilience, and efficiency of electricity transmission grids. Grid 
congestion is managed efficiently; 
• Enhanced observability of grids and improved forecasting of supply, demand, grid 
capacity availability, and flexibility; 
• Transmission system operators (TSO) leverage modern digital solutions and employ 
improved systems to effectively manage their grids and improve interoperability with 
other TSOs; 
• Vendor-agnostic reference architectures, solutions and tools are developed to help 
advancing the TSO control room design and operation.   
Scope: Projects are expected to address all the following items: 
• Design and test innovative solutions, technologies and processes for advancing the way 
the TSO control rooms are designed and operated, increasing observability and entailing 
enhanced support for the operators, providing more automation and enhanced support for 
decision, faster response times and less room for error. The solutions are expected to 
incorporate both hardware and software aspects; 
• Analyse and include, as far as possible, solutions for Wide Area Monitoring Systems 
(WAMS) to extend the real -time monitoring and control capabilities over large areas, 
while coping with the decentralisation and increased complexity of the system; 
• The novel solutions are expected to help the operators to manage better grid congestion 
and incorporate more renewables while reducing curtailment. The solutions will 
facilitate data-driven grid operations, capitalising on real -time analytics and data from 
smart assets. The solutions may include preparation, recovery and/or restoration from 
incidents (including extreme weather events); 
• Help the grid operators to update their operational tools in light of the deep 
transformation of the grids, notably the distributed nature of generation. May include the 
option to de-centralise the control for increasing the resilience of decision-making; 
• Advance forecasting solutions for energy supply, demand and flexibility made available 
to the system operator, need for ancillary services, as well as for grid hosting capacity; 
provide advanced analytics and visualisations; 
• Develop interoperability between the control rooms of different TSOs (and using 
different vendor solutions) to secure seamless data exchanges and coordination. Develop 
interoperability between the TSO control rooms and other entities connected to the 
transmission grids, including the adjacent DSOs. 
• Leverage modern solutions, notably digital twins and artificial intelligence. Use security-
by-design and advanced protection mechanisms against cyber threats. Use and/or 
develop, to the greatest extent possible, open -source software solutions and or software 
modules; 
• Develop a manual and propose best practices on this matter to be used by other TSOs 
(including operation instructions). Identify remaining gaps and further needs for research 
and development.   
The demonstration, test and validation of the activities should be carried out in at least two 
pilots in different EU Member States or Associated Countries. 
Projects are expected to include at least two electricity Transmission System Operators 
(TSOs) and at least two universities and/or research organisations. 
Additionally, collaboration is encouraged with the following entities and projects: 
• at least one supplier of technology and solutions for TSO control rooms; 
• at least two distribution system operators, which manage grids that are connected to the 
grids operated by any of the TSOs that are partners in the project; 
• (at least) one project funded under the separate call ‘Advanced Distribution Management 
Systems (ADSM) for more efficient and flexible distribution grids’ with the view to 
strengthen TSO-DSO coordination and support interoperable solutions. To that end, the 
project proposals are expected to describe a credible mechanism to do so.   
This collaboration (minimum number of entities) is sought per project in total and does not 
necessarily apply per each pilot in particular. 
Selected projects are expected to contribute to the BRIDGE initiative 210  and actively 
participate in its activities.
