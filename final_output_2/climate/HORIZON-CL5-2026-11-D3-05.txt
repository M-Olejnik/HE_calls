selection of a proposal requesting different amounts. 
Indicative budget The total indicative budget for the topic is EUR 13.50 million. 
Type of Action Innovation Actions 
Eligibility conditions The conditions are described in General Annex B. The following 
exceptions apply: 
If projects use satellite -based earth observation, positioning, 
navigation and/or related timing data and services, beneficiaries must 
make use of Copernicus and/or Galileo/EGNOS (other data and 
services may additionally be used). 
Technology 
Readiness Level 
Activities are expected to achieve TRL 6-7 by the end of the project – 
see General Annex B. Activities may start at any TRL. 
Legal and financial 
set-up of the Grant 
Agreements 
The rules are described in General Annex G. The following 
exceptions apply: 
The granting authority may, up to 4 years after the end of the action, 
object to a transfer of ownership or to the exclusive licensing of 
results, as set out in the specific provision of Annex 5. 
 
Expected Outcome : Fully sustainable regional bioenergy value chains and efficient 
conversion can play an important role in renewable efficient power and heating generation 
and for reaching the EU climate and energy targets and contribute to European 
competitiveness and energy security. 
Project results are expected to contribute to at all of the following expected outcomes: 
• The demonstration of regional value chains for the use of locally to regionally sourced 
sustainable and cheap solid biofuel from upgraded biogenic residues and wastes in line 
with the provisions of the Renewable Energy Directive in high efficiency CHP plant 
creates opportunities for SMs, regional value generation and European knowledge 
advancement and international competitiveness in the sector.  
• Provide flexible renewable power and heat to local industries for their processes and 
allow for high penetration of renewables in the energy system by ensuring sustainable 
bioenergy base load capacity. 
• Provide replicable solutions, where bioeconomy stakeholders can benefit from the 
knowledge generated for the development of their strategies aligned with energy and 
environmental policy objectives and which can contribute to the objective of decreasing 
the EU’s and Ukraine`s dependence on fossil fuels and increasing energy security. 
• Regulatory and permitting authorities as well as investors and important actors of the 
value chain are in a better position to assess socio -economic and environmental aspects 
of the value chain, in particular on circularity, industrial resilience biodiversity and soil 
carbon.   
Scope: Demonstration of a viable regional value chain for the use of locally to regionally 
sourced sustainable and cheap solid biofuel from upgraded biogenic residues and wastes in 
line with the provisions of the Renewable Energy Directive in high efficiency CHP plants 
(between 10 MWe and 30 MWe) for continuous, cost-effective and low emission operation. 
Proposals are expected to cover long-term scenarios for base load operation within the energy 
system network ensuring socio -economic and environmental sustainability and in particular 
the exclusion of negative impacts on other regional bio -based value chains and biomass uses 
in line with the provisions of the Renewable Energy Directive (also on cascading use), 
biodiversity, water balance, air quality and soil carbon stocks and other bioeconomy sectors 
which should be assessed by a comprehensive life cycle analysis. For this purpose, the 
extraction of residues should respect locally defined retention thresholds for deadwood 
extraction and exclude negative impacts on soil quality and soil carbon 
To minimise possible local ecosystem interferences, biomass fuels from residues and wastes 
are expected to be the primary feedstock of the high -efficiency CHP plant. The biomass fuels 
are expected to be produced with the use of innovative preprocessing and upgrading 
technologies and through the adoption of advanced supply chains from a mixture of residues 
and wastes and exclude negative impacts not only overall, but in each individual harvest 
location, which results in specific operational, economic and logistical and supply chain 
challenges to be addressed. Proposals should foresee at least one regional value chain 
demonstration including use of the solid biofuel with verified quality and occurring GHG and 
air-pollutant reduction in an operational high efficiency CHP plant. Proposals should ensure 
adequate involvement of feedstock providers (e.g. farmers, foresters, municipalities) to 
strengthen their position in the value chains relevant for this topic. 
Proposals are expected to demonstrate ways for future efficient, cost -effective, robust, 
resilient and low pollution CHP plants (including retrofitting and excluding co -firing with 
fossil fuels) in a local industrial context. 
Plans for the exploitation and dissemination of results for proposals submitted under this topic 
are expected to include a strong business case and sound exploitation strategy. In this respect, 
collaboration with suitable networks like e.g. bioenergy clusters should be envisaged to avoid 
the development of overly site -specific solutions and to enhance replicability. The 
exploitation plans are expected to include preliminary plans for scalability, 
commercialisation, and deployment (feasibility study, business plan) indicating the possible 
funding sources to be potentially used (in particular the Innovation Fund). Special attention 
should be paid to estimating the GHG and air pollutant emissions reduction potential; projects 
will be encouraged to use the methodology in the Innovation Fund. Projects are expected to 
include at least one relevant local economic business case, outlining local value and supply 
chains and the expected number of local jobs including the overall industrial ecosystem at the 
place of deployment. Projects are encouraged to support the reconstruction of Ukraine by 
covering regional value chains in Ukraine and/or Ukrainian beneficiaries. 
This topic requires the effective contribution of SSH disciplines and the involvement of SSH 
experts, institutions as well as the inclusion of relevant SSH expertise, SSH research should 
look specifically at how synergies can be enhanced to achieve the topic’s objective in respect 
of socioeconomic sustainability. A gender -sensitive and intersectional approach can inform 
the development of inclusive solutions in solid biofuel supply and CHP, by identifying 
specific needs, developing solutions that address these needs, and monitoring their impacts on 
diverse groups.
