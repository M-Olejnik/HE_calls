HORIZON-CL5-2027-07-D3-32: Delivery of industrial CCUS clusters – Societal 
Readiness pilot 
Call: ENERGY 
Specific conditions 
Expected EU 
contribution per 
project 
The Commission estimates that an EU contribution of around EUR 10.00 
million would allow these outcomes to be addressed appropriately. 
Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of a 
proposal requesting different amounts. 
Indicative budget The total indicative budget for the topic is EUR 30.00 million. 
Type of Action Innovation Actions 
Eligibility 
conditions 
The conditions are described in General Annex B. The following 
exceptions apply: 
If projects use satellite -based earth observation, positioning, navigation 
and/or related timing data and services, beneficiaries must make use of 
Copernicus and/or Galileo/EGNOS (other data and services may 
additionally be used). 
Technology 
Readiness Level 
Activities are expected to achieve TRL 6 -8 by the end of the project – 
see General Annex B. Activities may start at any TRL. 
 
Expected Outcome: Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following outcomes:    
1. Near-to-market solutions for the safe integration and use of CCUS technologies in the 
energy- and carbon-intensive industry; 
2. A pipeline of projects that have the potential for commercial scale-up. 
3. Deeper understanding of the needs and concerns of diverse social groups involved in or 
potentially affected by the R&I development of the technology, thereby increasing the 
potential for beneficial societal uptake and building trust in results and outcomes.   
Scope: Projects are expected to be the de -risking first step to develop local or regional 
industrial CCUS clusters, i.e. (multi) source and (multi) sink solutions for the decarbonisation 
of the hard -to-abate industries of the region. Projects are expected to be the basis and 
orientation for future full -size projects. To maximise the impact, projects should have a 
substantial industrial involvement. 
Projects should address most, but not necessarily all of the below issues: 
• Detailed planning and preparation for retrofitting capture systems to existing industrial 
plants; 
• Demonstrating important system components; 
• Identification and characterisation of the clustering potential of (cross -border) regional 
CO2 emitters; 
• Optimisation of industrial symbiosis between emitters and potential users of CO2; 
• Development of tools to optimise the design and operation of the cluster(s) and operate 
CO2 streams with different compositions, flow rates and operating regimes to comply 
with the constraints for the shared transport and storage infrastructure; 
• Identification of potential regional users of a common CO2 infrastructure (this could also 
include enlargement counties, such as the Western Balkans, Ukraine and Moldova); 
• Comprehensive economic and technical assessment to identify the best (multimodal) 
transport options, including the re-use of existing infrastructure; 
• Development of business models for regional CO2 transport networks, including for 
dispersed industrial sites to link these to larger industrial clusters or pipeline networks; 
• Consideration of feasible CO2 geological storage services 
• Comprehensive set of studies and preparatory actions leading to permitting; 
• Scenarios for integrating CO2 infrastructure in (plans for) regional, national and/or 
cross-border energy networks (electricity, hydrogen, natural gas), also in relation to 
future changes in industrial landscape and energy supply mix.   
Projects are expected to deliver a strategy for the exploitation of results that includes plans for 
scalability, commercialisation, deployment, permitting procedures, and identified public and 
private funding sources for CAPEX and OPEX, like private equity, the InvestEU, the EU 
Catalyst Partnership, the Innovation Fund, and possibly the Regional Development policy 
funds. 
For CO2 capture, transport, utilisation and (in particular onshore) geological storage, public 
acceptability is paramount. Therefore, projects are expected to identify and engage relevant 
end users and societal stakeholders (such as civil society organisations, non -governmental 
organisations, and local associations) in deliberative activities, so as to consider and respond 
to their needs and concerns. 
This topic is a Societal-Readiness pilot: 
• Proposals should follow the instructions applying to the Societal Readiness pilot, as 
described in the introduction of the Horizon Europe Main Work Programme 2026 -2027 
for Climate, Energy and Mobility. They entail the use of an interdisciplinary approach to 
deepening consideration and responsiveness of R&I activities to societal needs and 
concerns. 
• This topic requires effective contribution of the relevant SSH expertise, including the 
involvement of SSH experts in the consortium, to meaningfully support Societal 
Readiness. Specifically, SSH expertise is expected to facilitate the socio -technological 
interface and enable the design of project objectives with Societal Readiness related 
activities.
