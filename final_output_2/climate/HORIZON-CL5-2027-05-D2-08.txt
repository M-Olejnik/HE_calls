HORIZON-CL5-2027-05-D2-08: Demonstration for Long -duration Battery Energy 
Storage Systems (BATT4EU Partnership) 
Call: BATTERIES and ENERGY 
Specific conditions 
Expected EU 
contribution per 
project 
The Commission estimates that an EU contribution of around EUR 
9.40 million would allow these outcomes to be addressed 
appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and 
selection of a proposal requesting different amounts. 
Indicative budget The total indicative budget for the topic is EUR 18.80 million. 
 
Type of Action Innovation Actions 
Eligibility 
conditions 
The conditions are described in General Annex B. The following 
exceptions apply: 
If projects use satellite -based earth observation, positioning, 
navigation and/or related timing data and services, beneficiaries must 
make use of Copernicus and/or Galileo/EGNOS (other data and 
services may additionally be used). 
The Joint Research Centre (JRC) may participate as member of the 
consortium selected for funding as a beneficiary with zero funding, or 
as an associated partner. The JRC will not participate in the 
preparation and submission of the proposal - see General Annex B. 
Technology 
Readiness Level 
Activities are expected to achieve TRL 6 -7 by the end of the project – 
see General Annex B. Activities may start at any TRL. 
Legal and financial 
set-up of the Grant 
Agreements 
The rules are described in General Annex G. The following exceptions 
apply: 
The granting authority may, up to 4 years after the end of the action, 
object to a transfer of ownership or to the exclusive licensing of 
results, as set out in the specific provision of Annex 5. 
 
Expected Outcome: Projects are expected to contribute to all of the following outcomes: 
• Demonstrated system -level long -duration energy storage (LDES) solutions, explicitly 
aimed at enhancing grid stability, resilience, and flexibility in Europe. 
•  Substantial reduction of Europe's dependence on critical raw materials through the use 
of abundant, low-cost, and sustainable materials. 
• Contribute to strategic insights for a coherent EU -wide stationary storage deployment 
strategy, enhancing European energy autonomy and sustainability. 
• Sufficient and reproducible operational data and insights to serve as reliable input 
towards detailed technoeconomic analyses.   
Scope: Proposals should focus on system-level demonstrations of innovative long -duration (> 
8 hours) battery storage concepts that can effectively support utility -scale energy systems or 
industrial consumers in achieving energy security and operational sustainability. 
Projects are expected to cover all the following points: 
• Demonstration of advanced long -duration storage technologies not yet on the market 
such as novel redox flow batteries (standard or mediated), high -temperature systems, 
metal-air systems, multivalent chemistries (organic or aqueous), or other non -
commercialised technologies or architectures. 
• Assessment and definition of use case(s) intended for the proposed technology (front -of-
the-meter grid-scale storage, behind-the-meter large industrial energy consumer, firming 
of renewable generation) along with quantified impact on improved grid resilience, 
reduced emissions, safety, and lowered energy storage cost. 
• Assessment of hybridization potential of complementary energy storage technologies 
(e.g., redox flow batteries with supercapacitors) to optimize overall system performance 
for the intended use case(s) and extending system lifecycle. 
• Utilization of abundant, low -cost, and sustainable materials, explicitly prioritizing 
materials with reliable and scalable European supply chains, accompanied by realistic 
and detailed pathways to production routes at scale. 
• Integration of advanced digital technologies, for accurate state -of-charge (SOC), state -
of-health (SOH), and lifetime predictions, optimizing battery management systems 
(BMS), energy management systems (EMS), and overall component performance for 
extended system longevity. 
• Comprehensive techno -economic analyses, including realistic assessments of CAPEX, 
OPEX, based on measured technical performance metrics (e.g., self -discharge rates, 
calendar life, cycle life, round -trip efficiency, necessary safety investments) to clearly 
establish economic viability and competitiveness for the intended use -case in 
comparison to the commercial, incumbent technology. 
• Comprehensive safety assessment at system -level, documenting potential concerns (e.g. 
flammability, toxicity, explosion potential) and mitigation strategies ahead of widescale 
adoption of technology.  
The Commission initiative for Safe and Sustainable by Design151 (SSbD) sets a framework for 
assessing the safety and sustainability of chemicals and materials which should be considered 
as a reference for project proposals. 
Whenever the expected exploitation of project results entails developing, creating, 
manufacturing and marketing a product or process, or in creating and providing a service, the 
plan for the exploitation and dissemination of results must include a strategy for such 
exploitation. The exploitation plans are expected to include preliminary plans for scalability, 
commercialisation, and deployment (feasibility study, business plan) indicating the possible 
funding sources to be potentially used (in particular the Innovation Fund). 
Proposals could consider the involvement of the European Commission's Joint Research 
Centre (JRC) 152 whose contribution could consist of performing experimental or desk -top 
research on battery performance or safety. For further information on the JRC’s possible 
contribution to the projects, please, search for additional publicly available information on the 
 
JRC’s website153 (EU Science Hub) on the NCP portal, or request specific information from 
the JRC (JRC-NCP-Network@ec.europa.eu) 
JRC will assure that all the other applicants receive the same information on the JRC’s 
possible contribution to the project (e.g., via the topic -specific FAQs under the Funding and 
Tenders Portal). 
This topic implements the co -programmed European Partnership on Batteries (Batt4EU). As 
such, projects resulting from this topic will be expected to report on the results to the 
European Partnership on Batteries (Batt4EU) in support of the monitoring of its KPIs.
