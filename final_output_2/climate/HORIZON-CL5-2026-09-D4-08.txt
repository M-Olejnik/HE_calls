HORIZON-CL5-2026-09-D4-08: Full -scale demonstration of heat upgrade solutions in 
industrial processes 
Call: BATTERIES and ENERGY 
Specific conditions 
Expected EU 
contribution per 
project 
The Commission estimates that an EU contribution of around EUR 9.00 
million would allow these outcomes to be addressed appropriately. 
Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of a 
proposal requesting different amounts. 
Indicative budget The total indicative budget for the topic is EUR 18.00 million. 
Type of Action Innovation Actions 
Eligibility 
conditions 
The conditions are described in General Annex B. The following 
exceptions apply: 
If projects use satellite -based earth observation, positioning, navigation 
and/or related timing data and services, beneficiaries must make use of 
Copernicus and/or Galileo/EGNOS (other data and services may 
additionally be used). 
Technology 
Readiness Level 
Activities are expected to achieve TRL 7 -8 by the end of the project – 
see General Annex B. Activities may start at any TRL. 
Legal and 
financial set-up of 
the Grant 
Agreements 
The rules are described in General Annex G. The following exceptions 
apply: 
The granting authority may, up to 4 years after the end of the action, 
object to a transfer of ownership or to the exclusive licensing of results, 
as set out in the specific provision of Annex 5. 
Eligible costs will take the form of a lump sum as defined in the 
Decision of 7 July 2021 authorising the use of lump sum contributions 
under the Horizon Europe Programme – the Framework Programme for 
Research and Innovation (2021 -2027) – and in actions under the 
 
Research and Training Programme of the European Atomic Energy 
Community (2021-2025) 234. 
 
Expected Outcome: Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected 
outcomes: 
• Based on the results of the project, at least one industrial sector with a significant heating 
demand in the EU and Associated Countries develops pathways and business models to 
measurably increase the recovery and upgrade of locally available heat for covering 
process needs and significantly or totally phasing out of fossil fuel use, while preserving 
or enhancing its global competitiveness. 
• Measurable improvement of renewable and/or industrial excess/waste heat recovery and 
upgrade solutions, possibly combined with thermal and/or electrical energy storage, in 
terms of energy efficiency, flexibility of electrical demand, climate and environment 
protection, reliability and safety, physical and cyber security, and profitability.   
Scope: This topic aims to satisfy the need for process heat in the more industrial sectors by 
upgrading excess/waste heat from the process itself, possibly combined with heat recovered in 
nearby locations or local renewable heat, as a cost -efficient way to improve energy efficiency 
and reduce the GHG emissions and air pollutants and the use of fossil fuels. Thermal and/or 
electrical energy storage can be integrated, if it can contribute to better matching heat sources 
with process needs and/or to offer more flexible electricity consumption from the grid. 
The temperature of the heat supplied to the process is not specified, but the proposals will be 
evaluated on their potential to enable the deployment of heat upgrade solutions in more 
sector(s) and process(es), where they are not yet state-of-the art. 
Projects must address all the following items: 
• Optimise and demonstrate physically within one or more operational industrial site(s), 
the transformation of process(es) in at least one industrial sector, by recovering 
excess/waste heat from the process itself, possibly combined with local renewable heat 
or heat recovered in nearby locations and local thermal and/or electrical energy storage, 
and by upgrading the heat (e.g. with heat pump) for use in the process(es). 
• Maximise the replicability and deployment of the concept/solution in the EU and 
Associated Countries’ plants in the same industrial sector. Already before starting the 
design phase, the needs of most EU and Associated Countries’ factories in the same 
industrial sector(s) should be surveyed and analysed in order to design a solution that can 
be adapted to meet most of them. 
• Identify common components, optimise and define a standardised version of them. 
 
• Develop open technical and economical guidelines and open tools for system design and 
business case development. 
• In case the targeted industrial sector(s) and process(es) has/have been covered by the 
actions under the topic LIFE -2024-CET-HEATPUMPS235, this proposal should build on 
the results of these actions and if possible, cooperate with them, both for the definition of 
the solution to demonstrate and the dissemination channels. 
• Disseminate results notably (but not only) to the relevant communities in cluster 4 
‘Digital, Industry and Space’ private-public partnerships and to JRC Sevilla and INCITE 
for work on BREFs in the context of the IED2.0.
