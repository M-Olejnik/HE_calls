HORIZON-CL5-2027-01-D1-10:  Understanding and avoiding maladaptation to climate 
change 
Call: CLIMATE 
Specific conditions 
Expected EU 
contribution per 
project 
The Commission estimates that an EU contribution of between EUR 5.00 
and 6.00 million would allow these outcomes to be addressed 
appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and 
selection of a proposal requesting different amounts. 
Indicative budget The total indicative budget for the topic is EUR 18.00 million. 
Type of Action Research and Innovation Actions 
Eligibility 
conditions 
The conditions are described in General Annex B. The following 
exceptions apply: 
If projects use satellite -based earth observation, positioning, navigation 
and/or related timing data and services, beneficiaries must make use of 
Copernicus and/or Galileo/EGNOS (other data and services may 
additionally be used). 
 
Expected Outcome: Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following outcomes: 
• Existing evidence on maladaptation is retrieved comprehensively, and new knowledge is 
generated for incorporation into main EU repositories, such as Climate -ADAPT or the 
portal of the EU Mission on Adaptation to Climate Change; 
• The risk and adaptation assessment frameworks are improved by better integrating the 
maladaptation dimension; 
• Guidelines and tools for maladaptation prevention and correction strategies are made 
available to adaptation stakeholders at relevant scales and inform the design and 
implementation of adaptation strategies and plans of the EU and Member States.   
Scope: Recent climate records, showing unprecedented temperatures and extreme weather 
events, underscore the urgent need for rapid, systemic and comprehensive adaptation to 
address the escalating impacts of climate change on all natural and managed systems. 
However, while adaptation is essential, not fully informed measures can backfire, leading to 
severe unintended consequences or to short-term gains that are not sustainable. In this context, 
maladaptation refers to adaptation actions unintentionally leading to increased risk of adverse 
climate-related outcomes, including via increased greenhouse gas emissions or air pollutants, 
socio-economic, biodiversity and environmental trade -offs, increased or transferred 
vulnerability and greater social inequity. 
Most of the adaptation plans and implemented actions are relatively recent, so even if the 
cases of maladaptation are increasingly documented, the evidence is still scarce and sparse, as 
the latest IPCC reports confirm. There is a need to learn from the increasing evidence of 
maladaptation across sectors and regions, both in Europe and globally, to prevent 
maladaptation in policy design and implementation (e.g. of the EU Adaptation Strategy). 
Actions should address all the following aspects: 
• Advance the understanding and identification of drivers that lead to maladaptation for a 
wide range of systems, socio -economic and environmental conditions. The analysis 
should be comprehensive and consider an integrated and systemic approach (including 
insights from Social Sciences and Humanities (SSH) to maladaptation causes and drivers 
of very diverse nature, such as trade -offs and feedbacks with other priorities and sectors, 
poor decision making and implementation practices and the inherent uncertainty and 
other features of the adaptation process). The analysis should also integrate the 
perspectives of public and private stakeholders and end -users, apply intersectional 
approach and include data disaggregated by gender, where relevant and feasible. 
• Map and analyse evidence to identify and validate effective adaptation practices that 
prevent maladaptation and help to identify maladaptive ones. Case studies should be 
used for this purpose, for monitoring and evaluation of the adaptation measures, policies, 
and actions at a local, regional, and national scale, and from regions and sectors with 
diverse characteristics and environmental conditions. Engagement of end -users is 
encouraged to ensure robust and realistic characterisation of maladaptation experiences. 
Among other sources, integrating evidence from and for the EU Mission on Adaptation 
to Climate Change is encouraged. Evidence and insights gained should be systematized 
and incorporated into main EU repositories. 
• Strengthen the methodological and analytical toolbox for complex climate risk and 
adaptation assessments to increase public understanding and policy awareness of 
maladaptation risks, and to advance both qualitative and quantitative understanding of 
the most important complex risk feedbacks, particularly when they may result in 
significant constraints on options for climate action. 
• Study and propose corrective responses for the identified maladaptation cases and 
provide systematised prevention guidelines and best practice examples to avoid 
maladaptive outcomes.  
Coordination and collaboration with most relevant on -going projects from Mission 
Adaptation, Cluster 5 Destination 1 “Climate Science and Responses" and from relevant 
Destinations from other Clusters is encouraged, especially for evidence retrieval, national 
scale assessment and methodological consistency. Specific resources should be devoted to 
this purpose and project scientific boards should cross -fertilised. Actions’ results should also 
contribute to future European Climate Risk Assessments.
