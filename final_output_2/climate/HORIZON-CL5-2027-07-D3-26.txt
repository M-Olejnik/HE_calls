HORIZON-CL5-2027-07-D3-26: Advanced Distribution Management Systems (ADSM) 
for more efficient and flexible distribution grids 
Call: ENERGY 
Specific conditions 
Expected EU 
contribution per 
project 
The Commission estimates that an EU contribution of around EUR 9.50 
million would allow these outcomes to be addressed appropriately. 
Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of a proposal 
 
requesting different amounts. 
Indicative 
budget 
The total indicative budget for the topic is EUR 28.50 million. 
Type of Action Innovation Actions 
Eligibility 
conditions 
The conditions are described in General Annex B. The following 
exceptions apply: 
If projects use satellite -based earth observation, positioning, navigation 
and/or related timing data and services, beneficiaries must make use of 
Copernicus and/or Galileo/EGNOS (other data and services may 
additionally be used). 
In line with the “ restriction on control in innovation actions in critical 
technology areas” delineated in General Annex B of the General Annexes, 
entities established in an eligible country but which are directly or 
indirectly controlled by China or by a legal entity established in China are 
not eligible to participate in the action. 
Subject to restrictions for the protection of European communication 
networks. 
Technology 
Readiness Level 
Activities are expected to achieve TRL 6 -8 by the end of the project – see 
General Annex B. Activities may start at any TRL. 
 
Expected Outcome: Project results are expected to contribute to all the following expected 
outcomes: 
• Enhanced reliability, resilience, controllability and efficiency of electricity distribution 
grids. Congestion in distribution grids is managed effectively; 
• Distribution system operators (DSO) leverage modern digital solutions and employ 
improved systems to effectively manage their grids and improve interoperability with 
TSOs and other DSOs; 
• Vendor-agnostic reference architectures, solutions and tools are developed to help 
advancing the ADSM design and operation and effectively manage a broad range of grid 
services.   
Scope: Projects are expected to address all the following items: 
• Design and test innovative solutions, architectures, technologies and processes for 
advancing the way the ADSM are designed and operated; 
• Provide ADSM software platforms that improve grid performance, controllability, and 
help integrating distributed energy resources (DERs) in an efficient way, while reducing 
congestion and improving grid flexibility; 
• Advance forecasting solutions for energy supply, demand, and flexibility made available 
to the system operator; provide advanced analytics and visualisations; 
• Advance interoperability, both with TSOs and other DSOs, as well as with the DERs at 
the edge of the grid; 
• Leverage modern solutions, notably digital twins and artificial intelligence. Use security-
by-design and advanced protection mechanisms against cyber threats. Use and/or 
develop, to the greatest extent possible, open -source software solutions and or software 
modules; 
• Develop a manual and propose best practices on this matter to be used by other DSOs 
(including instructions to operate the system). Identify remaining gaps and further needs 
for research and development.   
The demonstration, test and validation of the activities should be carried out in at least two 
pilots in different EU Member States or Associated Countries. 
Projects are expected to include at least three Distribution System Operators (DSOs) and at 
least two universities and/or research organisations. 
Additionally, collaboration is encouraged with the following entities: 
• at least one supplier of technology and solutions for ADMS; 
• at least one transmission system operator, which manage grids that are connected to the 
grids operated by any of the DSOs that are partners in the project; 
• (at least) one project funded under the separate call ‘Advanced TSO control rooms to 
enhance grid control and resilience’ with the view to strengthen TSO -DSO coordination 
and support interoperable solutions. To that end, the project proposals are expected to 
describe a credible mechanism to do so.   
This collaboration (minimum number of entities) is sought per project in total and does not 
necessarily apply per each pilot in particular. 
Selected projects are expected to contribute to the BRIDGE initiative 211  and actively 
participate in its activities.
