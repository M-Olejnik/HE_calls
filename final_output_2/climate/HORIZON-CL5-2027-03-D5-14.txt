Expected Outcome : Project’s results are expected to contribute to the following expected 
outcomes:    
1. Full-scale demonstration of the combined solutions aiming to reduce ship GHG intensity 
and energy savings by at least 55%, compared to 2008 levels.  
2. Development of a standardized framework to verify improvements stemming from 
energy efficiency measures and standardized interfacing with certification of renewable 
energy solutions to strengthen the implementation of FuelEU Maritime.  
3. Explore and establish assessment criteria, and sea-trial procedures for the combination of 
solutions.  
4. Adapt digital solutions towards standardised interface layers (hardware and software) to 
introduce data-driven optimisation and seamless integration. 
5. Facilitate the retrofitting of existing vessels with zero emission energy sources in 
combination with energy efficiency measures up to 2030.  
6. Address the safety and operational impacts on ships, ports and other land infrastructure, 
as well as training gaps in terms of skills and competencies necessary for the adoption 
and operation of these technologies onboard ships. 
7. Strengthen market confidence in the integration of technologies and ensure sustainability 
and continuation of project outputs, including the integrated technologies.  
 
8. Address possible trade -offs with air and water pollution (unintended higher NOx or 
Black Carbon, ammonia dispersion, etc.) linked to decarbonization (technologies and 
fuels).   
Scope: One of the key areas in the waterborne transport domain aimed at enhancing energy 
efficiency and subsequently reducing emissions of greenhouse gas (GHG) and air pollutants is 
the exploration, implementation, and assessment of renewable energy solutions and energy -
saving measures. To this end, numerous advancements (e.g., electric and hybrid propulsion 
systems, wind -assisted propulsion technologies, hull optimization, air lubrication systems 
etc.) have been made across various aspects of ships. However, a high energy -efficient vessel 
requires addressing specific challenges despite the significant technological advancements. 
One of the most critical factors relates to the combination and integration of different 
solutions and measures that may lead to additional energy savings concerning multiple ship 
elements such as energy conversion, propulsion, onboard energy consumer demands (e.g., 
hotel loads for passenger vessels, operation equipment for offshore vessels etc.), higher -
efficiency conventional or alternative power systems and others without compromising the 
ship’s safety and performance.  
Adaptability across different ship types and scalability, particularly for large vessels, are 
further challenges that require meticulous analysis. The shift towards zero emission entails 
significant investment costs, especially for small and medium -sized shipping companies, and 
consideration of financial viability is of paramount importance. Lastly, the absence of a 
concrete standardization framework poses a substantial barrier that must be adequately 
addressed and overcome.  
 Proposals are expected to address all the following aspects:    
1. Full-scale demonstration offering combined reduction of fuel consumption of at least 
55% compared to 2008 levels. Proposals should clearly define the baseline, either in case 
of retrofits or newbuilds, with respect to the ship’s existing or expected operational 
profile. 
2. Create a methodology estimating energy savings and reduced GHG intensity and 
emissions of air pollutants from each technology separately and the aggregated savings 
of combining these technologies in different scenarios.  
3. Design optimization to facilitate deployment on different ship types, with a focus on 
retrofit cases and replication.  
4. Capitalise on existing digital solutions for including energy optimization (e.g., smart 
control, energy management) and for seamless integration of technologies with the 
ship’s automation and class‑certification processes introducing and explore cyber 
security aspects of the developed solutions. 
5. Projects should consider how high amounts of data transfers for monitoring, 
optimization, and decision -making may pose risks in terms of data integrity, 
cybersecurity and propose approaches to address those risks.  
6. Assessment of environmental and wider benefits, including reduced emissions of air and 
water pollutants, and underwater noise, as well as cost -effectiveness of the combined 
solutions considering life-cycle assessment approaches.  
7. Focus on safety and operational aspects addressing any technical and operational 
challenges that may arise from the combination of energy efficiency solutions. 
8. Facilitate effective cooperation and joint training between vessel crews, ports, and shore-
side emergency services to promote safety preparedness, coordinated response strategies, 
and best practices.   
Proposals are expected to explain the contribution of their objectives, results, IP management 
and exploitation strategy to the EU added value creation and strategic autonomy throughout 
the supply and value chain, including competitiveness of the EU waterborne industry, 
enhancement of the EU’s R&I capacity, technological know -how capabilities and human 
capital, and resilience of the EU industrial and manufacturing base. Proposals are encouraged 
to prioritise shipyards, equipment manufacturers and providers located and/or manufacturing 
in the EU and EEA.  
This topic implements the co -programmed European Partnership on ‘Zero Emission 
Waterborne Transport’ (ZEWT). As such, projects resulting from this topic will be expected 
to report on results to the European Partnership ‘Zero Emission Waterborne Transport’ 
(ZEWT) in support of the monitoring of its KPIs.
