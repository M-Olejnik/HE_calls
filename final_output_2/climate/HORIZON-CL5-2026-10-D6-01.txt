Expected Outcome : This flagship pilot is the culmination of the entire activity catalogue 
carried out by the CCAM Partnership since its launch in 2021. It will combine in one project 
the most promising CCAM use -cases across three key domains, with the technological 
advancements from all its R&I clusters 274  supporting and enabling CCAM systems and 
services towards market uptake. 
This action is expected to contribute to all the following outcomes: 
• Large-scale demonstrations of inclusive, user -oriented, and well -integrated CCAM 
systems and services for people and goods in mixed traffic through Field Operational 
Tests (FOTs), Technology Pilots, and Living Labs, building upon advanced and 
emerging SAE Level 2 systems to move towards SAE Level 3 and 4 functionalities, at 
multiple test sites and corridors showcasing CCAM potential 275, for a minimum of 12 
months. 
• Validation of enabling technologies that facilitate the extension of Operational Design 
Domains (ODDs) in large -scale operations and enhance perception performance under 
poor lighting and adverse weather conditions in large -scale demonstrations and pilots. 
Assessment of deployment readiness and demonstration of technological maturity 
focusing on their reliability, security, and real-world applicability. 
• Identification of the remaining technological and societal development needs to 
accelerate deployment and drive user and societal demand. These demonstrations will 
strengthen the connection with users and society through a co -creative process, ensuring 
that technological developments align with real-world needs and societal expectations. 
• Recommendations for regulatory action aimed at facilitating the deployment of 
Automated Vehicles (AVs) in Europe, by engaging with relevant policy and regulatory 
bodies. 
• Identification and selection of viable business models for each of the use -cases explored 
per domain, aiming for continued operation after the flagship pilot through private 
investment or national/local public funding including mechanisms for transferability and 
replicability to enable a broader application of results to other cities and regions.  
Scope: CCAM solutions are expected to provide a more user -centred, inclusive mobility 
system that enhances safety, reduces congestion, lowers harmful emissions, and contributes to 
decarbonization. In addition, CCAM solutions enhance transport effectiveness, thereby 
strengthening Europe's competitiveness in the global mobility sector. Novel mobility services 
can enable seamless integration with existing services such as public transport and logistics, 
while higher levels of automation are expected to boost transport productivity and efficiency. 
However, the benefits of these solutions must be proven through large -scale demonstrations, 
validating their effectiveness for both people and goods. It is also of key importance to 
integrate and test enabling vehicle technologies and to validate trusted communication and 
 
cyber security, as well as real time information transmission. Moreover, a comprehensive 
assessment of technology maturity is necessary, evaluating the readiness of automated driving 
functions within mixed traffic conditions and in confined areas. This evaluation helps 
determine the readiness of automation technologies for deployment, considering factors such 
as operational reliability, regulatory compliance, and user acceptance. By fostering a 
systematic approach to large -scale demonstrations, technology validation, and maturity 
assessment, and by prioritising zero -emission mobility, these efforts contribute to the 
seamless integration of CCAM solutions across the entire public and private transport 
ecosystem. 
The proposed action is expected to demonstrate different CCAM solutions and technologies 
in all the following domains: 
• Individual mobility within mixed traffic environments, encompassing urban, suburban, 
motorway, and rural settings, with a focus on the seamless integration of automated and 
conventional vehicles. Use cases should consider diverse road conditions, infrastructure 
variability, traffic dynamics, and user needs, ensuring safe, efficient, accessible and user-
centric mobility solutions. A key aspect is the integration of advanced technologies (e.g. 
AI, V2X, cybersecurity, precise positioning, etc.) and the validation of technological 
enablers ensuring that automation solutions are robust, scalable, and adaptable to all 
CCAM use cases for people and goods. 
• Shared mobility and public transport operations in urban, regional and rural areas, for 
end-to-end journeys aiming to enhance safety, accessibility, equity, and sustainability, 
including improving business cases for mobility providers. Validate realistic door -to-
door mobility services including links to mobility hubs, ridesharing and parking areas to 
enhance end-to-end journeys in urban areas and regions. 
• Freight transport  for hub -to-hub, corridors, and logistics hubs on public roads and 
confined areas, integrating logistics, fleet and terminal operators. Validate realistic end -
to-end use cases, such as logistics hubs at airports, ports, cross -border, and transhipment 
terminals, connecting use-cases in confined operations with TEN-T freight corridors.  
Where relevant, intersecting social factors, such as gender, age, social origin and income level 
should be considered. All new vehicles acquired for the project's activities, as well as all 
vehicles participating in final demonstrations conducted in public spaces, are expected to be 
environmentally friendly, with a special focus on electric vehicles, to maximise synergies and 
ensure the future integration of solutions into the sustainable mobility mass market. 
The proposed action should integrate all the following common activities across domains: 
• Ensuring close coordination and synergies with innovation actions planned under the 
European Connected and Autonomous Vehicle Alliance, (ECAVA), in particular the 
Autonomous driving technology roadmap, announced by the European Automotive 
Action Plan. 
• Leveraging on the Coordination and Support Action, HORIZON-CL5-2025-01-D6-02: 
Preparing for large-scale CCAM demonstrations.276 
• Leveraging on the Coordination and Support Action HORIZON-CL5-2024-D6-01-05 
Robust Knowledge and Know -How transfer for Key -Deployment Pathways and 
implementation of the EU-CEM.277 
• Ensuring close coordination, once launched, with HORIZON-CL4-2027-04-DATA-08: 
Demand-side 3C pilot demonstrators on converged Telco Edge Cloud Infrastructure , in 
particular the pilot demonstrator on unlocking telco -edge-cloud functions for the 
mobility ecosystem. 
• Ensuring inclusive engagement of all key European private stakeholders (e.g., shared 
mobility, public transport and logistics operators, infrastructure providers, associations, 
SMEs and start -ups, in particular technology developers), and notably a broad 
representation of the European OEMs, in addition to Tier -1 suppliers, as well as public 
players (e.g., municipalities/cities/regions, motorway operators, emergency service 
operators, public transport authorities, research institutions) and community groups (e.g., 
user groups) for the transport of people and goods, across their entire value chain, in the 
designated domains. Each of these shall contribute to European technological 
innovation, sovereignty and competitiveness and none shall contrive the security and/or 
public policy interests of the Union. 
• Assessing the transferability, adaptability, and scalability of advanced technologies such 
as photonics and Generative AI as key enablers for the extension of ODDs , ensuring 
broad deployment potential. 
• Executing public engagement and awareness campaigns to increase societal readiness 
and promoting the use of CCAM as well as implementing CCAM education and training 
programs. 
• Assessing the degree to which the demonstrated services comply with current regulatory 
requirements and providing recommendations to ensure full compliance.  
Bringing forth real -world evidence on the effects, impacts, and long -term implications of 
integrating mixed CCAM solutions into the mobility system including long -term impact for 
users. 
• Exemplifying concrete and strategic benefits of vehicle -vehicle or vehicle-infrastructure 
cooperation to improve safety, optimize traffic flow, and enhance the overall efficiency 
of CCAM transportation networks considering both digital and physical infrastructure 
and including guidance for remote operations and management. 
 
• Using data from large -scale demonstrations to identify and extract pertinent scenarios 
and edge cases, ensuring these insights are systematically integrated into related 
databases for validation scenarios, while also exploring data sharing opportunities with 
relevant authorities. 
• Facilitating the interoperability of connected and automated systems across vehicle 
brands, regions, and Member States and Associated Countries, taking into consideration 
different traffic environments and road densities, also in line with the Automotive Action 
Plan on large-scale cross-border testbeds. 
• Encouraging collaboration with the European Software -defined Vehicle (SDV) initiative 
by adopting existing interfaces and proposing new ones developed within the project for 
potential inclusion in the SDV framework.
