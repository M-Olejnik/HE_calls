Expected Outcome: Project results are expected to contribute to all the following expected 
outcomes: 
• Assessment of Europe’s CCAM position in global competition, identifying strategic 
vulnerabilities, dependencies and opportunities across business models, supply chains, 
critical components, technological capabilities, infrastructure, and regulatory 
frameworks, supported by advanced AI-driven analytics and innovation mapping tools. 
• Stakeholder-driven, participatory future scenarios and strategic pathways that define 
Europe’s leading role in the evolving geopolitical, technological, and economic 
landscape of CCAM. These should be developed using advanced foresight methods (e.g. 
 
qualitative scenarios, horizon scanning, technology roadmapping, etc.), complemented 
by iterative validation through a minimum of 3 dedicated Living Labs selected to 
represent diverse European regions, urbanisation levels, and governance capacities, 
ensuring a structured, robust, and anticipatory approach to long-term decision-making. 
• A data -driven understanding of the socioeconomic effects of different CCAM 
deployment pathways, based on a quantified assessment across Member States and 
Associated Countries, economic sectors, and demographic groups, at national and cross -
national levels, using innovative, integrated economic -transport modelling that captures 
dynamic interactions, systemic feedback loops, and long -term impacts. Socioeconomic 
effects may include, but are not limited to, employment and growth aspects, equity, and 
transport poverty. 
• Robust governance models, policies and business strategies (including for SMEs and 
micro-enterprises) that strengthen Europe’s leadership, economic resilience, and market 
positioning in CCAM, developed through interdisciplinary methods combining policy 
analysis, institutional diagnostics, and scenario -based stress testing, to ensure robustness 
under diverse future geopolitical and economic conditions. These should identify viable 
business cases, recommend sectoral R&D priorities, and support innovation scaling for 
both public and private entities. Additionally, they should ensure long -term adaptability 
to geopolitical and market uncertainties, promote equitable growth, reduce external 
dependencies, and mitigate supply chain vulnerabilities, all while promoting sustainable 
growth. 
• Ensuring close coordination and synergies the European Connected and Autonomous 
Vehicle Alliance (ECAVA), in particular the autonomous driving roadmap, announced 
by the European Automotive Action Plan.  
Scope: CCAM is a key area of global competition and one of the five pillars of the European 
Automotive Action Plan for the automotive sector, aimed at helping the industry regain its 
leadership in the shift towards smarter (AI -powered), cleaner, and more connected vehicles, 
However, CCAM deployment is shaped by evolving geopolitical dynamics, rapid 
technological advancements, and economic uncertainties. Europe must secure its leadership in 
CCAM and strengthen its socioeconomic resilience by continuously addressing vulnerabilities 
and identifying robust pathways for policy development and market deployment. This topic 
will assess the global geopolitical landscape of CCAM innovation, map future pathways, and 
develop evidence -based strategies for policymakers, businesses, and investors. The results 
will support robust, future -proof policies, business strategies, and investment frameworks, 
ensuring a resilient, inclusive, and competitive European CCAM ecosystem. 
Proposed actions are expected to address all of the following aspects: 
• Conduct a comprehensive geopolitical and economic analysis of CCAM to map 
Europe’s strategic position in global competition. Identify vulnerabilities, dependencies 
and opportunities in business models, supply chains, critical raw materials, technological 
capabilities, digital and physical infrastructure, validation processes, safety benchmarks, 
and pricing strategies, supported by AI -driven analytics and innovation mapping tools. 
The analysis should also assess large -scale CCAM initiatives worldwide, identifying 
scaling trajectories, tipping points, commercialization barriers, and success factors. 
These insights should inform strategic policymaking, investment decisions, and Europe’s 
regulatory positioning in global CCAM markets. 
• Develop novel, stakeholder -driven participatory future scenarios to explore plausible 
geopolitical, technological, and economic developments affecting CCAM, and define 
associated transition pathways toward desirable European futures that ensure resilience, 
strategic autonomy, and competitiveness. Use advanced foresight methods (e.g. 
qualitative scenarios, horizon scanning, technology roadmapping, etc.), complemented 
by iterative validation through a minimum of three dedicated Living Labs, to understand 
trade-offs, assess risks, and define strategic priorities under different global conditions. 
The project should also identify KPIs that capture European added value, unique selling 
points, and global market positioning, and apply these to assess and guide CCAM 
competitiveness The project should also identify KPIs that measure the European added 
value, its unique selling points and global market positioning, to apply these KPIs to 
define CCAM competitiveness. 
• Assess the socioeconomic impacts of different CCAM deployment pathways, focusing 
on economic, employment, and social equity dimensions. Analyse income growth, 
employment effects, regional economic convergence, and productivity gains using 
integrated economic -transport modelling approaches that account for dynamic 
interactions and systemic feedback across Member States and Associated Countries, 
economic sectors, and demographic groups. Identify potential disparities and propose 
policy recommendations and investment strategies to ensure that CCAM contributes to 
inclusive, equitable, and sustainable economic growth across all regions of Europe. This 
should include an evaluation of how CCAM deployment can reduce Europe’s reliance 
on external supply chains, while enhancing industrial competitiveness. 
• Develop robust policy recommendations, governance models, and business strategies 
informed by institutional diagnostics and tested under diverse future conditions through 
scenario-based stress testing to reinforce Europe’s leadership and economic resilience in 
CCAM. Ensure regulatory alignment with global standards, strengthen supply chain 
resilience by reducing reliance on non -EU dependencies, and promote an open yet 
competitive market environment. Business strategies should identify viable business 
cases, recommend sectoral R&D priorities, and support innovation scaling, particularly 
for SMEs and micro -enterprises. Policies and strategies must be adaptable to shifting 
geopolitical and economic conditions, securing Europe’s long -term market 
competitiveness and technological sovereignty.  
This topic requires the effective contribution of SSH disciplines and the involvement of SSH 
experts, institutions as well as the inclusion of relevant SSH expertise (including social 
innovation), in order to produce meaningful and significant effects enhancing the societal 
impact of the related research activities. 
Projects funded under this topic are expected to collaborate with the CCAM Technology 
Observatory by exploring and leveraging complementarities between their respective 
activities and findings281. 
This topic implements the co -programmed European Partnership on ‘Connected, Cooperative 
and Automated Mobility’ (CCAM). As such, projects resulting from this topic will be 
expected to report on results to the European Partnership ‘Connected, Cooperative and 
Automated Mobility’ (CCAM) in support of the monitoring of its KPIs. 
Projects resulting from this topic are expected to apply the European Common Evaluation 
Methodology (EU-CEM) for CCAM282.
