HORIZON-CL5-2027-01-D1-09: Assessing the performance of policy instruments to 
inform climate change mitigation action 
Call: CLIMATE 
Specific conditions 
Expected EU 
contribution per 
project 
The Commission estimates that an EU contribution of around EUR 3.00 
million would allow these outcomes to be addressed appropriately. 
Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of a 
proposal requesting different amounts. 
Indicative budget The total indicative budget for the topic is EUR 9.00 million. 
Type of Action Research and Innovation Actions 
Eligibility 
conditions 
The conditions are described in General Annex B. The following 
exceptions apply: 
If projects use satellite -based earth observation, positioning, navigation 
and/or related timing data and services, beneficiaries must make use of 
Copernicus and/or Galileo/EGNOS (other data and services may 
additionally be used). 
Legal and 
financial set-up of 
the Grant 
Agreements 
The rules are described in General Annex G. The following exceptions 
apply: 
Eligible costs will take the form of a lump sum as defined in the 
Decision of 7 July 2021 authorising the use of lump sum contributions 
under the Horizon Europe Programme – the Framework Programme for 
Research and Innovation (2021 -2027) – and in actions under the 
Research and Training Programme of the European Atomic Energy 
Community (2021-2025) 104. 
 
Expected Outcome: Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected 
outcomes: 
• Enhanced knowledge of the effectiveness of policy instruments on EU and Member 
State level to inform mitigation action and policy improvements, ensuring a fair 
transition and social acceptability; 
• Methodologies are developed and improved for ex -ante assessment and ex -post 
evaluation of greenhouse gas emission reductions from climate policies and measures; 
• Strengthened collaboration and established networks between researchers, policy experts 
and government officials involved in designing and evaluating climate policies on EU 
and national level.   
Scope: As the EU and its Member States intensify efforts to reduce their greenhouse gas 
(GHG) emissions to achieve climate neutrality by 2050, understanding the effectiveness and 
acceptability of policy instruments becomes crucial. The implementation of the European 
Green Deal and climate legislation under the recent “Fit -for-55" package has further 
emphasised the need to better identify and quantify the impact of climate policies and 
measures both on EU and national level. Many policies are also subject to fast -changing 
political dynamics. Ex-post evaluation can help explain whether emission reductions occurred 
and explain why, while also identifying other benefits or trade-offs of climate mitigation. 
 
By 2023, the EU had achieved a 37% reduction in its GHG emissions compared to 1990 
levels105. However, even after almost two decades of EU climate policies, there is still limited 
understanding of the effectiveness of mitigation policies. The increasing complexity of the 
policy mix makes it difficult to clearly link individual policies or measures to specific 
emission reductions and other benefits in different sectors. The interaction with other thematic 
policies such as those on biodiversity, agriculture and trade is therefore also important. 
This topic is expected to assess the performance of EU policies and measures for reducing 
GHG emissions. The focus is on sectors not covered by the current EU Emission Trading 
System (ETS 1)106. This would include gaining insights into factors that influence behavioural 
change and acceptance of policies, taking into account gender -specific aspects. Actions 
should consider economic, social, distributional and other effects of mitigation action, 
including trade-offs and co-benefits such as vis-à-vis climate resilience. 
Actions should go beyond traditional decomposition analysis and employ state -of-the-art 
econometric techniques. They are expected to improve existing methodologies or develop 
new ones to help distinguish the contribution of GHG emission reductions between policy -
driven effects and external drivers. Machine learning and other digital tools and methods 
could be applied to fill information gaps and gain additional insights. 
Actions should assess the impact of national policies on Member State level and how such 
policies interact with EU-wide policies and measures. They should also identify and highlight 
examples of national policies and measures that have successfully reduced GHG emissions 
and brought other environmental, social and economic benefits. Actions are expected to 
develop, test or improve methodologies and tools for ex -ante estimates of GHG emission 
reductions when designing policies and measures on EU and national level, including 
integrating climate objectives in other policies. This should include economy -wide modelling 
which takes into account cross -sectoral feedbacks as well as price responsiveness and 
behavioural change by consumers. 
Actions are encouraged to use available datasets on climate mitigation policies and measures, 
such as the OECD/CAPMF database 107 , and the integrated national climate and energy 
policies and measures datahub hosted by the European Environment Agency (EEA) 108. The 
use of additional activity data provided by EUROSTAT 109 or national statistical sources may 
be necessary to provide a comprehensive understanding of policy impacts. 
All projects funded under this topic are strongly encouraged to connect, coordinate, and 
participate in networking and joint activities to foster cross -project cooperation and exchange, 
particularly to reinforce synergies between methodologies. 
 
This topic requires interdisciplinary collaboration between political scientists, economists and 
other relevant Social Sciences and Humanities (SSH) disciplines. Actions are also strongly 
encouraged to include a process of mutual learning and co -creation with stakeholders (e.g., 
representatives of governments, public administrations, NGOs and academia) to meet end -
user needs and support the uptake of results.
