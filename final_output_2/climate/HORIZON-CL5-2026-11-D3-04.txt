HORIZON-CL5-2026-11-D3-04: De -risking renewable fuel technologies through 
transnational pre-commercial procurement of renewable fuel industrial value chains 
Call: ENERGY 
Specific conditions 
Expected EU 
contribution per 
project 
The Commission estimates that an EU contribution of around EUR 
40.00 million would allow these outcomes to be addressed 
appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and 
selection of a proposal requesting different amounts. 
Indicative budget The total indicative budget for the topic is EUR 40.00 million. 
Type of Action Pre-commercial Procurement 
Admissibility 
conditions 
The conditions are described in General Annex A. The following 
exceptions apply: 
Due to the complexity of the topic, the page limit for proposals is 
increased to 60 pages. 
Eligibility 
conditions 
The conditions are described in General Annex B. The following 
exceptions apply: 
If projects use satellite -based earth observation, positioning, navigation 
and/or related timing data and services, beneficiaries must make use of 
Copernicus and/or Galileo/EGNOS (other data and services may 
additionally be used). 
 
Expected Outcome: Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected 
outcomes: 
• Public authorities, industry, technology providers, energy producers and consumers 
profit from de -risking of cost -effective essential value chains of those renewable fuel 
technologies that can contribute to domestic commercial fuel production beyond 2030 
customized to their needs, from improved access to better financing exploiting synergies 
across funding schemes, and from more effective market uptake, business models, 
increased competitiveness, and commercialization opportunities. 
• Energy producers, clean tech manufacturing industries, researchers and consumers 
benefit from improved performance, lower environmental impact, security and 
competitiveness of ad -hoc renewable fuel technologies compared to existing ones, as 
well as new market opportunities. 
• Community, public authorities and industry benefit from sharing the de -risking cost and 
reducing it by engaging several competing solution suppliers/technology providers in 
parallel, boosting transnational public and private investments in de -risking and 
attracting new players to tackle supplier lock-in issues 
• The implementation of the Strategic Energy Technology Plan (SET Plan) Action of 
Renewable Fuels and Bioenergy is supported and facilitated by better alignment of 
public and private R&I priorities and of funding mechanisms. 
• Policy makers and regulators are provided with evidence to accelerate permitting 
procedures and increase the public acceptance of innovative and sustainable renewable 
fuel projects improving the regulatory framework.  
Scope: An exceptional effort is needed to develop, demonstrate and de -risk essential 
renewable fuels technologies and establish their industrial value chains in a cost-effective way 
to cover the EU needs where renewable fuels are the main long -term solution. Proposals 
should steer the development of these technologies at EU level and bring them to the market. 
Pre-commercial procurement of R&D, validation and possibly, first deployment of industrial 
value chains of essential renewable fuel technologies is considered an effective tool to de -risk 
such activities and overcome the “valley of death” because real take off by engaging primarily 
concerned contracting entities is expected. The scope of this action is to design and bring 
industrial value chains of essential renewable fuel technologies at TRL 8 by the action end. 
The competitive development in phases of entire industrial value chains should built upon 
existing knowledge on technology and value chain readiness based on existing EU projects 
and studies, thus speeding up the de-risking.  
‘Transnational buyers’ could be public plus possibly one or more private procurers, and that 
provide similar services of public interest. The buyers will collectively develop and 
implement the pre-commercial procurement of R&D services from a number of providers and 
designate a lead procurer to award the contracts. The procurement must be open to providers 
of R&D services established in any EU Member States and Associated Countries. 
Inclusiveness of a broad range of public and private procures across EU and Associated 
Countries and across national borders is encouraged, to effectively share the risk and benefit 
from creating in the EU market readiness of industrial value chains of essential renewable fuel 
technologies. Public and private EU airport and port authorities and their respective managing 
bodies, aircraft operators and shipping companies, other state, regional or local authorities and 
bodies governed by public law or their associations, are some examples of expected public 165 
and private procurers with an incentive to improve solutions in areas of public interest, such 
as reduction of greenhouse gas emissions from energy supply as fuels.  
The consortium is encouraged to plan activities during the project to raise awareness to the 
R&D providers that will win PCP contracts about unlocking and increasing their investment 
capacity in the field of renewable fuel technologies, for example by using possible 
combinations of the PCP procurement contract with additional support for companies from 
the EIC, InvestEU, regional funds or possibly other sources of Union funding. Participation of 
public contracting authorities and entities managing or funding such funds in the project is 
encouraged. In addition, the procurers should include in the proposal what will be their 
 
planned approach for deployment in case the PCP results in successful solutions; this could be 
through a combination of deploying a limited set of solutions already during the PCP project 
and/or foreseeing a deliverable that prepares follow -up procurement to purchase (larger 
volumes of) such type of solution(s) after the PCP. 
Essential value chains to de -risk should be based on identified technologies by our studies 166 
(i) – vii) below) as those that can contribute essentially to domestic commercial fuel 
production beyond 2030, and possibly other that can be demonstrated at commercial scale by 
the end of the execution phase of the project167:    
i. Production of advanced bioEthanol and further processing into ATJ-SPK 
ii. Biomass Gasification and FT-Synthesis to produce FT-SPK 
iii. Production of BioMethanol for further processing into MTJ 
iv. Hydrotreatment of Lipids from marginal/contaminated lands to produce HEFA 
v. Biomass Pyrolysis and Upgrading or co -processing to produce biokerosene and bio -
heavy fuel oil 
vi. Biomethane from AD and Gasification and Methanation to produce biomethane for 
shipping or further processing into methanol (methanolysis) for shipping 
vii. E-Methanol production from CO2 and renewable H2 for shipping   
Industrial value chains of the essential renewable fuel technologies should be developed based 
on domestic sustainable feedstocks across EU and Associated Countries and on also creating 
synergies across all end use energy and transport sectors for markets and production facilities 
for renewable fuels. 
Hydrogen production as end-product is not in scope.
