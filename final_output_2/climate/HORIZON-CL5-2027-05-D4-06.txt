HORIZON-CL5-2027-05-D4-06: Thermal energy optimisation and waste heat recovery 
of high energy demand IT rooms in buildings or small edge data centres 
Call: BATTERIES and ENERGY 
Specific conditions 
Expected EU 
contribution per 
project 
The Commission estimates that an EU contribution of around EUR 5.25 
million would allow these outcomes to be addressed appropriately. 
Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of a 
proposal requesting different amounts. 
Indicative budget The total indicative budget for the topic is EUR 15.75 million. 
Type of Action Innovation Actions 
Eligibility 
conditions 
The conditions are described in General Annex B. The following 
exceptions apply: 
If projects use satellite -based earth observation, positioning, navigation 
and/or related timing data and services, beneficiaries must make use of 
Copernicus and/or Galileo/EGNOS (other data and services may 
additionally be used). 
Technology 
Readiness Level 
Activities are expected to achieve TRL 6 -7 by the end of the project – 
see General Annex B. Activities may start at any TRL. 
Legal and 
financial set-up of 
the Grant 
Agreements 
The rules are described in General Annex G. The following exceptions 
apply: 
The granting authority may, up to 4 years after the end of the action, 
object to a transfer of ownership or to the exclusive licensing of results, 
as set out in the specific provision of Annex 5. 
Eligible costs will take the form of a lump sum as defined in the 
Decision of 7 July 2021 authorising the use of lump sum contributions 
under the Horizon Europe Programme – the Framework Programme for 
Research and Innovation (2021 -2027) – and in actions under the 
Research and Training Programme of the European Atomic Energy 
Community (2021-2025) 230. 
 
 
Expected Outcome: Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected 
outcomes: 
• Improved open access to performance data, sharing of best-practices and useful 
knowledge and information for owners and operators of IT infrastructure, as well as the 
IT and building sectors; 
• New designs of IT rooms in buildings or small edge data centres valorise waste heat 
through thermal management techniques, processes and tools.   
Scope: The growing energy needs of the ICT sector must be met while aligning with climate 
neutrality and sustainability goals. Small IT rooms or small data centres are an essential part 
of the twin green and digital transition. It is important to address the energy and resources 
consumption over the full ICT value chain. Solutions already exist, such as re -using waste 
heat from data centres, or moving towards circular models (longer lifetimes, reparability, 
reuse and recyclability). Most recent analysis suggests that the energy consumption of 
consumer devices in 2020 accounted for roughly 50% of the overall energy consumption of 
ICT technologies, with the two next largest contributors being respectively the production of 
ICT devices (~20%) and the operation of data centres (~15%) 231. Moreover, this is expected 
to change dramatically by 2030, as the overall energy consumption of ICT technologies is 
expected to increase by 50% over this decade. The Commission has set the strategic goal of 
ensuring that data centres are climate -neutral, energy - and resource efficient by 2030. 
However, most efforts are directed towards data centres in scope of the Energy Efficiency 
Directive recast. 
Proposals should address all of the following: 
• Demonstrate state -of-the-art holistic and cost -effective approaches to thermal 
management and excess heat recovery (optionally including heat storage and/or upgrade 
of heat) and re -use in local or nearby site creating effective added value in existing IT 
rooms in buildings or small edge data centres (in the range of 100 -500kW, not covered 
by Energy Efficiency Directive recast), taking into account thermal envelope/building 
(by means of simulation or digital twins, among others), integration with building 
automation and control systems and potential to improve the self -assessment and self -
optimisation functionalities at all levels, and integration into existing BMS allowing for 
further development of energy services. Demonstrators should be located in both cold 
and warm climate Member State or Associated Country to tackle climate specific 
challenges of thermal management of waste heat. 
• Develop business cases for state -of-the-art solutions for excess heat recovery & re -use 
(optionally including heat storage and/or upgrade), for example by re -using excess heat 
in an existing system in the building (such as heating or water production purposes), or 
 
in a local district heating and cooling network, or in any other local or nearby site 
creating effective added value to the recovered heat.  
Projects funded under this topic are encouraged to build synergies and leverage their 
outcomes with funded projects from Cluster 4 HORIZON -CL4-2027-04-DATA-09: Energy 
efficiency and sustainability of AI data processing in Data Centres (IA) demonstration pilots.
