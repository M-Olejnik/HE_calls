HORIZON-CL5-2027-03-D5-20: Assessing the effect of airport operations on air quality 
and noise in nearby communities 
Call: MOBILITY 
Specific conditions 
Expected EU 
contribution per 
project 
The Commission estimates that an EU contribution of around EUR 3.50 
million would allow these outcomes to be addressed appropriately. 
Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of a 
proposal requesting different amounts. 
Indicative budget The total indicative budget for the topic is EUR 7.00 million. 
Type of Action Research and Innovation Actions 
Eligibility 
conditions 
The conditions are described in General Annex B. The following 
exceptions apply: 
If projects use satellite -based earth observation, positioning, navigation 
and/or related timing data and services, beneficiaries must make use of 
Copernicus and/or Galileo/EGNOS (other data and services may 
additionally be used). 
Technology 
Readiness Level 
Activities are expected to achieve TRL 5 -6 by the end of the project – 
see General Annex B. Activities may start at any TRL. 
Legal and 
financial set-up of 
the Grant 
Agreements 
The rules are described in General Annex G. The following exceptions 
apply: 
The granting authority may, up to 4 years after the end of the action, 
object to a transfer of ownership or to the exclusive licensing of results, 
as set out in the specific provision of Annex 5. 
Eligible costs will take the form of a lump sum as defined in the 
Decision of 7 July 2021 authorising the use of lump sum contributions 
under the Horizon Europe Programme – the Framework Programme for 
Research and Innovation (2021 -2027) – and in actions under the 
Research and Training Programme of the European Atomic Energy 
Community (2021-2025) 273. 
 
Expected Outcome: Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected 
outcomes: 
• Assessment of the impact of airport operations on air quality and water bodies (including 
biodiversity) through air quality measurements and monitoring at different spots in and 
around the airports as well as through in vitro testing and/or remote sensing for water 
quality in airports close to water bodies 
• Contributing to the delivery of better emission factors for emissions inventories and 
projections (including EMEP), especially for species and fuel mixtures for which little 
knowledge exists today in order to support local, regional, national and international 
emissions reduction plans (e.g. Noise Plans, Air Quality Roadmaps, Air Quality Plans, 
national Air Pollution Control Programmes, as mentioned in EU acquis) by providing 
real-world emission information and measuring the actual impact of control measures 
and strategies. 
• Recommendations for improved measurement certification and testing to better cover 
real world situations. 
 
• Develop a methodology to assess the health impact (both the nature, seriousness and 
number of people at risk) of the measured pollutants and noise in airports or at the 
nearby urban environment and apply it to the test sites.  
Scope: Aviation emissions not only have an impact on climate change and on GHG emissions 
but also on -air quality as it is recognized that airport -related sources of emissions release 
pollutants that can contribute to the degradation of air quality of their nearby communities. As 
such, air quality and noise issues in the vicinity of airports need to be investigated, quantified 
and addressed. Airports operations can generate water pollution due to their extensive 
handling of jet fuel and de -icing chemicals, which, if not contained, can contaminate nearby 
water bodies. Similarly, attention must be given to other possible airport -related 
environmental impacts associated with noise, water quality, and local ecology in the vicinity 
of airports. 
In order to address these issues, the following R&I actions should be undertaken: 
• Comprehensive real time and real -world measurements of pollutant (exhaust and non -
exhaust, including resuspension of dust) and noise emissions. The sources of emissions 
should be differentiated, and the pollutants identified. Operations should include ground 
operations, landing and take -off (including emissions from tyres and brakes) and 
assessing exhaust emission during cruising, including impact of changes in flight altitude 
on engine performance parameters (stationary engine tests). The calibration of the 
measurement systems and the reproducibility of the results should be demonstrated. 
• Pilot testing in 2 different airports (possibility as well for testing on other complex 
transport nodes) for proof of concept with the aim of increasing scalability and 
replicability for other similar environments. Proposals are expected to select specific 
airports that are in vicinity of urban/rural communities and close to water 
streams/bodies, to examine and quantify the effect of airport emissions on air quality, 
noise and water bodies. 
• Investigation of the adverse health and environmental effects (including biodiversity) of 
particle emissions, NOx, and non -regulated emissions (e.g. black carbon, tyre and brake 
particles, secondary organic aerosols, etc.) generated from aircraft and airport operations. 
The analysis should be supported by gender disaggregated data collection and 
intersectional analysis. 
• Estimates of the impact of APUs (Auxiliary Power Unit) or GPUs (Ground Power Units) 
to stationary aircrafts’ emissions (GHG, air pollutants and noise) compared to 
conventional operation.  
Proposals should consider the results from previously EU funded projects such as AVIATOR, 
nPETS, TUBE, ANIMA , NEEDED or any other similar projects.
