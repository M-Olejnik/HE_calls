as set out in the specific provision of Annex 5. 
Eligible costs will take the form of a lump sum as defined in the 
Decision of 7 July 2021 authorising the use of lump sum contributions 
under the Horizon Europe Programme – the Framework Programme for 
Research and Innovation (2021 -2027) – and in actions under the 
Research and Training Programme of the European Atomic Energy 
Community (2021-2025) 319. 
 
Expected Outcome: Project results are expected to contribute to all the following expected 
outcomes: 
 
• Development of systems that utilize real -time data analytics to dynamically respond to 
disruptions, allowing transport and infrastructure operators to adjust operations swiftly 
and efficiently; 
• Development of predictive maintenance strategies applying innovative Generative AI 
solutions and utilizing other digital technologies to anticipate and prevent infrastructure 
and equipment failures; 
• Development of guidelines and tools to support passenger transport operators and 
authorities to ensure minimal disruption in unexpected and critical situations and 
organise real life emergency simulations; 
• Deployment of training programme for transport and infrastructure operators on how to 
handle transport disruption, including tools and catalogue with contingency planning for 
specific transport disruptions; 
• Reduction of average passenger delay at corridor level (at least 20%) during planned 
disruptions, compared to the baseline and of (at least 40%) time needed from the 
generation to the dissemination of a response plan to different stakeholders (e.g. 
transport operators, passengers, citizens) during unplanned and critical events, compared 
to the baseline.   
Scope: Passenger transport systems are a critical component of urban, sub -urban, and long -
distance travel, facilitating connectivity, reducing traffic congestion, and supporting 
environmental sustainability. However, these systems face challenges such as operational 
disruptions, safety and security risks, and evolving passenger demands. 
In the context of passenger transport, resilience refers to the ability of a transport system to 
absorb disturbances, maintain its basic structure and function, and recover to a required level 
of service within acceptable time and cost after being affected by disruption. This involves 
implementing measures that ensure continuous operation, quick recovery from unexpected 
events, and adaptability to changing circumstances. Enhanced resilience is essential for 
maintaining public trust and ensuring smooth functioning of transport systems and it is a 
cornerstone of the EU Sustainable and Smart Mobility Strategy. 
Proposed actions are expected to address all of the following aspects: 
• Development and implementation of measures to enhance the resilience of urban, sub -
urban and long-distance transport systems. 
• Leveraging digital technologies (e.g. big data, digital twins) and in particular generative 
and discriminative AI for anticipating and predicting the evolution of disruptions and 
their impacts, with real -time planning and information systems for minimizing impact 
and enabling faster recovery. 
• Use of innovative technologies for data acquisition and integrate data from various 
sources to inform decision -making and optimise strategies, and generate scenario 
libraries for different disruptive events and monitor the implementation of the response 
plans 
• Involve authorities and operators in the design process to create holistic solutions that 
are user-friendly and aligned with their needs. 
• Conducting safety and security assessments in data interpretation, ensuring decisions are 
based on objective factors while avoiding biases. 
• Test and validate the aspects above in real-life use cases in multimodal transport corridor 
within urban, sub -urban and long -distance passenger transport with minimum three 
transport modes per use cases (e.g. buses, metros, trams, trains, coaches, trolleybuses, 
ferries, share mobility) in at least three pilot sites situated in different Member States and 
reflecting a diversity of operational, geographic, and technological contexts.   
Proposals are encouraged to building on results from previous calls on infrastructure and 
transport resilience (e.g. HORIZON -CL5-2024-D6-01-11, MG -7-1-2017, HORIZON -CL5-
2021-D6-01-09), multimodal traffic management (e.g. HORIZON -CL5-2022-D6-02-05, MG-
2-11-2020), shared mobility and public transport (e.g. HORIZON -CL5-2022-D6-02-04, 
HORIZON-MISS-2021-CIT-02-02). Proposals should also comply with existing EU 
framework and strategies and building upon the concepts and solutions developed in other 
Union initiatives aimed to facilitate data sharing in transport, such as the European mobility 
data space (EMDS). Particular efforts should be made to ensure that the data produced in the 
context of this topic is FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Re-usable).
