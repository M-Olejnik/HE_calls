HORIZON-CL5-2026-09-D3-03: Innovative technologies and solutions to improve wind 
energy systems supporting the Strategic Energy Technology (SET) Plan on wind  
Call: BATTERIES and ENERGY 
Specific conditions 
Expected EU 
contribution per 
project 
The Commission estimates that an EU contribution of around EUR 
93.00 million would allow these outcomes to be addressed 
appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and 
selection of a proposal requesting different amounts. 
Indicative budget The total indicative budget for the topic is EUR 93.00 million. 
Type of Action Innovation Actions 
Admissibility 
conditions 
The conditions are described in General Annex A. The following 
exceptions apply: 
Due to the complexity of the topic, the page limit for proposals is 
increased to 60 pages. 
Eligibility 
conditions 
The conditions are described in General Annex B. The following 
exceptions apply: 
If projects use satellite -based earth observation, positioning, navigation 
and/or related timing data and services, beneficiaries must make use of 
Copernicus and/or Galileo/EGNOS (other data and services may 
additionally be used). 
Technology 
Readiness Level 
Activities are expected to achieve TRL 6 -8 by the end of the project – 
see General Annex B. Activities may start at any TRL. 
Legal and financial 
set-up of the Grant 
Agreements 
The rules are described in General Annex G. The following exceptions 
apply: 
Beneficiaries must provide financial support to third parties (FSTP). 
The support to third parties can only be provided in the form of grants. 
The maximum amount to be granted to each third party is EUR 1 000 
000. This is necessary to appropriately conduct the activities in scope of 
this topic, namely, to contribute to the development of costly and 
complex components and use costly research and technology 
 
infrastructures in the wind sector. These activities are as well labour 
intensive and need specialised skills. As the topic envisages subsequent 
FSTP calls to progressively develop a given solution, the maximum 
amount to be granted to each party needs to be sufficiently high to cater 
for cases where a given legal entity may receive more than one FSTP 
grant. 
 
Expected Outcome: Project results are expected to contribute to all the following expected 
outcomes: 
• Advance in the achievement of the Strategic Energy Technology (SET) Plan’s research 
and innovation priorities and targets for wind energy; 
• Efficient and effective support to wind energy research and innovation through 
alignment and cooperation among different actors, avoiding fragmentation of efforts; 
• Energy producers and consumers benefit from increased performance of wind energy 
technologies with the focus on efficiency and flexibility, reduced cost, improved 
reliability and sustainability, operation and maintenance, safety, robustness and security 
during all stages of the lifetime of a wind energy farm from installation, operation and 
maintenance to decommissioning; 
• Increased contribution of wind energy to the energy system, with minimal impacts on 
health and the environment (notably biodiversity and pollution) and at the lowest 
possible cost.   
Scope: The action contributes to address the Strategic Energy Technology (SET) Plan’s 
research and innovation priorities and targets for wind energy, as defined by the 
Implementation Working Group (IWG) on wind energy, the European Technology and 
Innovation Platform on wind energy (ETIP Wind) 160  and the European Energy Research 
Alliance (EERA) joint programme on wind energy161. 
The activities carried out by the project will pertain to the following priority R&I areas:   
a. Industrialisation, scale -up and competitiveness: mass production supported by 
automation and reliable supply chains, design for large volume manufacturing and 
deployment, design for reliable and lasting products and improved construction and 
installation methods, digitalisation and artificial intelligence (AI) in industrial 
environment. 
b. Optimisation and further digitalisation of operation and maintenance: integration of 
artificial intelligence (AI), robotics, advanced repair methodologies and new sensor 
technologies, interoperability among wind farm sub -systems, advanced communication 
 
technologies and cybersecurity, innovative component replacement solutions and quick 
connect/disconnect systems for mooring lines and inter-array cables. 
c. Wind energy system integration: definition and modelling of future system needs, 
advanced grid capabilities, interoperability, solutions to effectively manage curtailment, 
integration with energy storage technologies and hybrid plants, distributed wind energy. 
d. Sustainability and circularity: material substitution for decarbonisation, material 
reduction, recycling methods, lifetime extension via re -using, refurbishing and re -
purposing, new decommissioning tools and methods and solutions to minimise the 
environmental and biodiversity impacts and optimise the socio-economic impacts. 
e. Floating offshore wind: development and demonstration of innovative technologies for 
offshore floating wind. Development of optimised floating wind energy systems through 
the integrated design of the different elements of the system, including the floater and 
the generation part. 
f. Research and technology infrastructures for wind energy: upgrade of existing and 
establishment of new infrastructures and test centres for the sector. An area of particular 
interest in this domain are large -scale testing facilities for offshore floating wind energy 
systems. 
g. Wind energy systems interactions with climate, atmosphere, ocean and geophysics: 
geophysical characteristics measuring and modelling, wake effect model development, 
climate change impact analysis 
h. Environmental and social aspects, coexistence: evolution of environmental impact 
assessments, spatial planning, biodiversity solutions, reduced pollution (e.g. noise and 
vibration, pollution due to erosion of the blades), design and implementation of practices 
and platforms that facilitate inclusive communication and stakeholders’ involvement, 
tools to map stakeholder concerns and development of practical approaches to lifecycle 
public participation, socialisation of wind rights, relationship between people, 
technology and places for all relevant social issues 
i. Emerging technologies: new concept assessment and development (e.g. multirotor 
concepts, tip rotor designs, ducted turbines), improved performance and efficiency of 
emerging/innovative wind energy systems  
Structure, breakdown of activities and budget allocation 
The action consists of activities directly implemented by the consortium and activities 
implemented through financial support to third parties. The R&I activities are divided into 
three challenges:   
1. Breakthrough challenge 
2. Validation challenge 
3. Demonstration challenge  
The breakthrough and the validation challenge can be carried out both through activities 
directly implemented by the core consortium and through FSTP activities. 
The breakthrough challenge entails actions to develop new and potentially disruptive 
solutions, tools and new knowledge to increase the competitiveness of the wind energy sector 
and on the acceleration of wind energy deployment at scale both off - and onshore, including 
with experimental proof of concept, as well as with validation both in laboratory and relevant 
environment, as appropriate. Concepts and technologies initially developed through the 
breakthrough challenge could be further matured through the validation challenge. 
The validation challenge entails actions to validate technologies, tools and innovative 
solutions, both in a laboratory and in a relevant environment that have been developed in the 
project but also developed previously and separately in other European and national projects. 
For the validation, the project can consider different use cases (e.g. onshore, offshore). 
The demonstration challenge entails demonstration activities to accelerate the take up of 
innovation by the industry, in line with the priorities set by the SET Plan (activities up to TRL 
7-8). It will solely be implemented by the core consortium. 
The total maximum amount of EU funding for the demonstration activities is expected to be 
50 million Euros. 
The project is expected to implement at least 3 demonstration activities. The focus of each 
demonstration activity should be clearly different from each other. The proposed solutions 
should be demonstrated for a continuous period of at least 6 months. 
The project is expected to include a clear go/no go milestone, for each demonstration activity, 
before entering the deployment phase. Before each go/no -go milestone, the project is 
expected to show evidence of having in place i) all needed permits for deployment, ii) 
complete, detailed and realistic engineering plans, compliant with the applicable standards 
and iii) a complete business and implementation plan. The project proposal is expected to 
present a clear and convincing pathway to obtain necessary permits for the demonstration 
activities and allow for appropriate timelines to achieve these. The project proposal is also 
expected to demonstrate how it will get a financial close for each demonstration activity. For 
this, the use of other EU/national/regional support mechanisms can be considered. 
Privileged research and innovation areas for the demonstration challenge are the ones listed 
from a. to f. in the scope: a. industrialisation, scale -up and competitiveness, b. optimisation 
and further digitalisation of operation and maintenance, c. wind energy system integration, d. 
sustainability and circularity, e. floating offshore wind and f. research and technology 
infrastructures for wind energy. 
The activities of the core consortium are expected to include the implementation of direct 
research and innovation activities in any of the areas listed in scope and in any of the 
challenges (breakthrough, validation, demonstration). The core consortium will be responsible 
for the management of the whole project, including the actions carried out through financial 
support to third parties (management of the FSTP calls, management of the FSTP projects). It 
is expected that the budget dedicated to the project management will not exceed 7% of the EU 
funding. 
Activities implemented through Financial Support to Third Parties (FSTP) 
A share of the EU funding will be implemented through financial support to third parties and 
used to support research organizations, academia, start -ups, scale-ups, SME’s, industries and 
other entities and to enable use-cases that are not yet identified in the proposal stage. 
The use of financial support to third parties should allow a faster implementation of research 
and innovation activities, attracting different stakeholders and innovators to develop and 
validate new technological solutions in the wind sector and respond quickly to new 
challenges. A tiered approach to address complex R&I challenges should be adopted via 
FSTP calls, meaning that projects with a relatively short duration should be supported (e.g. 
12-18 months). A given action supported by FSTP can be implemented by one third party or 
by a (small) consortium of entities. Subsequent FSTP calls can be used to give further support 
to successful initiatives. The calls should be planned carefully and ensure that successful R&I 
work can continue without major interruption. 
The demonstration challenge is excluded from FSTP calls. 
For the FSTP calls, the following should be taken into account:   
1. Breakthrough challenge: The proposal should include consecutive FSTP calls for the 
development of breakthrough technologies and innovative solutions in support of the 
long-term R&I challenges. Up to 8 million EUR of the EU requested contribution should 
be used to set up this ‘Breakthrough technologies’ challenge for third parties. The FSTP 
breakthrough challenge should aim at attracting innovative entities that does not 
necessarily have the capacity to apply directly for EU grants. 
2. Validation challenge: The proposal should include consecutive FSTP calls for the 
validation of innovative technologies/solutions developed in the breakthrough challenge 
or from earlier R&I projects. Up to 16 million EUR of the EU requested contribution is 
expected to be used for subsequent FSTP calls. FSTP will be used to engage other 
entities not earlier identified.  
The first FSTP call for the breakthrough challenge should be published in the first year of the 
project. The FSTP calls for the validation challenge must be published in a later stage 
considering the experience and the results of the breakthrough challenge and/or the core 
project R&I activities. The duration of the actions supported by FSTP should not be longer 
than 18 months. 
The activities carried out through FSTP calls can pertain to any of the research and innovation 
areas listed in scope. The applicants must clearly describe in their proposal the objectives and 
the expected results of the FSTP call. 
For the FSTP calls, the consortium is expected to take into account the provisions on 
‘financial support to third parties’ set out in Annex B of the General Annexes and incorporate 
them into the proposal. The consortium should consider specifically elements within the FSTP 
schemes to address broad EU geographical balance. 
The FSTP calls should be open to any public or private entities, including SMEs. 
Applicants are advised to consult the European Commission’s guidance on FSTP activities162. 
Governance of the project 
The project will have to set out how and with what frequency the calls for proposals to be 
funded through financial support to third parties (FSTP) are organised and how the evaluation 
of these proposals is carried out. The core project consortium needs to define the selection 
criteria and the process and criteria of organisations, for which financial support may be 
granted, ensuring compliance with the FSTP rules under Horizon Europe. The proposal 
should describe clearly the methodology to implement the various steps of the FSTP calls, 
define the specifications of the stages of the competitions, timelines, targets, KPIs and a solid 
evaluation methodology including evaluation criteria. The consortium is also responsible for 
ensuring high visibility of the FSTP calls. 
The core consortium is expected to demonstrate proven experience in sound financial 
management of large projects, including public procurement and/or calls and grants to support 
third parties, in particular for the beneficiaries that will manage the FSTP calls. 
The project sets up an Advisory Board, composed of experts in wind energy systems’ research 
and innovation, representing public and private entities that are independent from the 
beneficiaries of the project. A representation of the SET Plan Implementation Working Group 
(IWG) on Wind Energy, the Clean Energy Transition Cofund Partnership related initiative 
and of the European Commission should be as well part of the Advisory Board. The Advisory 
Board advises the project to ensure coherence and alignment with the SET Plan activities and 
goals. The consortium will ensure that the advice of the Advisory Board is appropriately taken 
into account in the project’s implementation. This will be monitored by the granting authority. 
The proposal should define mechanisms to assess and demonstrate progress (with qualitative 
and quantitative key performance indicators (KPIs), benchmarking and progress monitoring). 
Besides defining and tracking progress of technology -specific KPIs in the technology areas 
specifically covered, the project should monitor and report on the contribution towards the 
 
high-level SET Plan KPIs defined by the SET Plan community in the wind energy sector 163. 
The project should report the progress of all its R&I activities according to these mechanisms 
and KPIs with an annual deliverable and milestone for the project execution according to 
plan. 
The consortium will have to present a clear risk and mitigation plan. In this plan special 
attention should be paid to the risk that the chosen demonstration actions will not reach a go -
decision. 
In the project proposal, the consortium will have to describe all challenges and actions for the 
whole duration of the project, including the activities to be carried out directly by the core 
consortium and the ones carried out through financial support to third parties (FSTP). A given 
action supported by such FSTP scheme can be implemented by one third party or a by 
consortium of entities. 
As regards data management, in addition to fulfilling the standard research data management 
and open access requirements in line with the Grant Agreement provisions, the project is 
expected to set up a platform, possibly re -using an already existing one, to ensure the 
accessibility and maintenance of the data generated by the project. The platform should be 
able to organise and host data generated by other research and innovation projects on wind 
energy. Particular efforts should be made to ensure that the data produced in the context of 
this topic is FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Re-usable) 
The consortium should define measures to maximise the impact of the successful project and 
for that will contribute to the relevant Knowledge Community and Impact Network of the 
Clean Energy Transition Partnership and share communicable results with the European R&D 
community. 
Cooperation with International Energy Agency (IEA) Technology Collaboration Programme 
(TCP) on wind energy systems 
For activities carried out that are also covered by relevant initiatives under the International 
Energy Agency Technology Cooperation Programme for wind energy systems 164, proposals 
should envisage liaising with these initiatives to consider possible synergies, cooperation and 
mutual sharing of knowledge. 
Duration 
The estimated project duration is around 5 years.
