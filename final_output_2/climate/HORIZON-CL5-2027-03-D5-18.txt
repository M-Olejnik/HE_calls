Expected Outcome: Project outputs and results are expected to contribute to all the following 
expected outcomes:    
1. Demonstrate autonomy, of at least 150 nm (or 277.8 KM for inland navigation) using 
electrical storage as the only energy source, while allowing rapid in -route zero-emission 
replenishment.  
2. Increase the power output, providing beyond 5 MW as peak propulsion power with 
corresponding grid capacity.  
3. Improve systems to increase the number charging cycles combined with high -power 
charging to suit the operation needs of different ship types and services.  
4. Identify the operating profiles and business cases for which electric powered shipping 
will bring significant improvements taking into account the priorities and provisions of 
the Fitfor55 package, especially FuelEU Maritime, Naiades III, AFIR and RED.  
5. Develop solutions fitting different ship types and their operational profiles and provide 
roadmaps for replication.  
6. Address the degradation and failure in specific maritime operating conditions.  
7. Improved lifetime and safe use of batteries in waterborne transport by addressing the 
operation profiles, degradation and failure modes associated with unique waterborne 
transport operating conditions.   
Scope: This topic aims to improve the suitability of fully -battery-electric operation of ferries, 
short sea shipping, offshore and inland vessels, considering the services they provide, their 
operation profiles and the possibilities to interact with charging infrastructure. Aspects like 
increasing the autonomy range of operation and fast charging are a crucial element for short 
sea shipping and inland routes with short docking periods. Fast charging may also put added 
strain on batteries in terms of output and durability. Optimization of the onboard electrical 
architecture and battery chemistry as well as optimized battery monitoring and management 
systems and more extensive training of crew can to some extent address this challenge. Life 
cycle aspects should be considered by design in the integration and operation of vessels, as 
well as the end -of-life of batteries, making sure that operations can be performed during the 
whole expected life of the vessel. The topic also explores the need to increase the power 
capability of fully electric vessels, aiming to define scenarios in which the increase of the 
peak propulsion power is needed to ensure the safety of operations. Proposals should cover 
the interface between vessels and port operations addressing the regulatory requirements, 
including operational procedures.  
Proposals should address all the following aspects:  
• Full scale demonstration of innovative solutions for extended range and extended battery 
cycles beyond simple scaling up of existing commercial batteries. Solutions to increase 
the current operational range of electric vessels to at least 150 nm (or 277.8 KM for 
inland navigation) for short -sea shipping, ferries, offshore of 400 -6500 GT vessels, or 
86-135 meters for inland river vessels on free -flowing rivers upstream, allowing rapid in 
route charging and being applicable to representative operating conditions of the chosen 
ship. Demonstration of the vessel’s economic viability in normal operation. 
Demonstrations should also consider baseline reference which are already state of the art 
• Identifying the operational profiles and services that require higher energy output for 
safe and effective operation, developing solutions and modelling scenarios to ensure safe 
and efficient energy management and navigation taking into account the battery pack 
and recharging possibilities.  
• Incorporating energy-efficiency measures, including but not limited to, efficient AC -DC 
grid, thermal management, high voltage electrical components, energy management and 
energy modelling for optimal operation. 
• Implementation of vessel‑wide adaptive energy‑management solutions that coordinate 
battery, propulsion and hotel loads, maximising cycle life while minimising emissions. 
• Development of solutions for intelligent and optimized battery management to improve 
energy efficiency and life extension of the batteries. Furthermore, projects should 
consider life cycle aspects by design and address the end -of-life of batteries to ensure 
full electric operation during and beyond the planned operation of the vessel. 
• Creating concepts for rapid zero -emission in -route charging, fast charging, offshore 
charging or battery replenishment, including solutions capable of supplying power to 
idling vessels anchored offshore near ports, while maintaining desired operating 
schedules, adhering to current standards. 
• Encouraging modular design and ship retrofitting to facilitate replication of the solution, 
ideally presenting one full retrofit exercise and several replications in similar or different 
vessels, also including the needs of the OPS infrastructure. 
• Development of recommendations and best practices for the safety assessment of the 
novel installations based on field testing. This should build on established safety 
guidelines and requirements such as the Guidance on the Safety of Battery Energy 
Storage Systems onboard ships (from the European Maritime Safety Agency – EMSA) 
and the requirements for fixed and swappable batteries on inland vessels (from the 
European Committee For Drawing Up Standards In The Field Of Inland Navigation – 
CESNI), as applicable , and contribute to their applicability to a wider scope of novel 
electrification solutions. Furthermore, recommendations for improving the guidelines 
and extending them to the demonstrated new battery installation solutions should be 
presented. Regulatory aspects for the pertinent safety -critical ship systems as well as fire 
safety solutions for the battery room should also be addressed. In addition, the 
recommendations should also consider how integration of the safety considerations 
affects the overall operational planning and economic assessments. 
• The plan for exploitation and dissemination of results should identify adequate business 
cases and provide roadmap for the replication and deployment of the proposed 
technology, including plans for scalability, commercialization, and deployment. 
Proposals should identify and propose opportunities for further market uptake. 
• Establishment of strong collaboration between industry, training providers and higher 
education institutions to develop specialized courses on enhanced waterborne transport 
battery management.   
Proposals must justify the contribution of their objectives, results, intellectual property (IP) 
management and exploitation strategy to the EU added value creation and strategic autonomy 
throughout the supply and value chain, including competitiveness of the EU waterborne 
industry, enhancement of the EU’s R&I capacity, technological know -how capabilities and 
human capital, and resilience of the EU industrial and manufacturing base. Proposals are 
encouraged to prioritise shipyards, equipment manufacturers and suppliers located in the EU 
and EEA. 
This topic implements the co -programmed European Partnership on ‘Zero Emission 
Waterborne Transport’ (ZEWT). As such, projects resulting from this topic will be expected 
to report on results to the European Partnership ‘Zero Emission Waterborne Transport’ 
(ZEWT) in support of the monitoring of its KPIs.
