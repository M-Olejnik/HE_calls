HORIZON-CL5-2027-02-D3-08: Co -funding Strategic Energy Technology (SET) Plan 
renewable fuel value chains at EU, national, regional, and local level 
Call: BATTERIES and ENERGY 
Specific conditions 
Expected EU 
contribution per 
project 
The Commission estimates that an EU contribution of around EUR 
30.00 million would allow these outcomes to be addressed 
appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and 
selection of a proposal requesting different amounts. 
Indicative budget The total indicative budget for the topic is EUR 30.00 million. 
Type of Action Programme Co-fund Action 
Admissibility 
conditions 
The conditions are described in General Annex A. The following 
exceptions apply: 
Due to the complexity of the topic, the page limit for proposals is 
increased to 60 pages. 
Eligibility 
conditions 
The conditions are described in General Annex B. The following 
exceptions apply: 
If projects use satellite -based earth observation, positioning, navigation 
and/or related timing data and services, beneficiaries must make use of 
Copernicus and/or Galileo/EGNOS (other data and services may 
additionally be used). 
Legal and financial 
set-up of the Grant 
Agreements 
The rules are described in General Annex G. The following exceptions 
apply: 
The funding rate is 70% of the eligible costs. 
Beneficiaries may provide financial support to third parties (FSTP) in 
the form of grants. 
The maximum amount of FSTP to be granted to each third party is 
EUR 500 000. This is justified because cascading grants linked to FSTP 
will support concrete R&I interregional projects to be undertaken by 
research and innovation entities and stakeholders around the 
technologies value chain of renewable fuels. Such R&I collaborative 
projects require high costs for labour, equipment and materials to 
successfully carry out their activities in order to achieve the objectives 
of this action, otherwise this would be impossible. 
 
Expected Outcome: Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected 
outcomes: 
• Advance in the realisation of the Strategic Energy Technology (SET) Plan Action of 
Renewable fuels and Bioenergy (for the fuels part) is supported, overcoming 
fragmentation by mobilizing resources and establishing across EU  interregional value 
chains of renewable fuel technologies and by better alignment of public and private R&I 
priorities and of funding mechanisms. 
• All sector stakeholders benefit from establishment of  renewable fuels value chains at 
EU, national, regional, and local level overcoming fragmentation across Europe. 
• Different stakeholders (e.g., EU, SET Plan countries, regions, communities, etc) benefit 
from their engagement in the co -creation of a very flexible R&I Programme in 
renewable fuels. 
• Researchers, industry, and public authorities have access to increased knowledge and 
challenges of the different renewable fuel technologies along their lifecycle and value 
chains and benefit from synergies to overcome fragmentation of the value chains and 
from increased critical mass in implementing R&I activities in the area. 
• Technology providers profit from technology development, successful demonstration 
and de-risking of a portfolio of renewable fuel technologies, improved access to better 
financing exploiting synergies across funding schemes, and from more effective market 
uptake, increased competitiveness and commercialization opportunities. 
• Energy producers, clean tech manufacturing industries and consumers benefit from 
improved performance and security of a portfolio of renewable fuel technologies and 
from better exploitation opportunities in a larger and more homogeneous marketplace. 
• Policy makers and regulators are provided with evidence to accelerate permitting 
procedures and increase the public acceptance of innovative and sustainable renewable 
fuel projects, minimizing negative environmental impacts including biodiversity, and 
improving the regulatory framework.  
Scope: Following the revamp of the SET Plan and its anchoring to the NZIA and the 
European Research Area, it becomes urgent to boost the R&I activities envisaged already 
under the SET Plan Implementation Plans and their further updates and contribute towards 
pooling diverse resources to increase the R&I funding and impact across the European 
Research Area. This action is complementary to existing projects and instruments like the 
Clean Energy Technology (CET) Partnership 171  with the vision to support, facilitate and 
reinforce that work by providing a focused programming framework and coordinated network 
of active and connected stakeholders in renewable fuels. 
This action aims to create connected regional renewable fuel value chain activities across 
Europe, involving regions with lower innovation performances, by sharing and transferring 
capacities and know -how. The challenge is to overcome fragmentation of the value chains 
 
where different regions have different capacities (feedstock, technology, skills) and create 
collaboration at EU, national, regional or local level to collectively develop and implement 
complete value chains of renewable fuel technologies. 
The action should contribute to the implementation of the Implementation Plan 172 and its 
updated version(s) of the Implementation Working Group of Renewable fuels and Bioenergy 
under the revamped SET Plan. All renewable fuel technologies, both of biological and non -
biological origin, at all TRL levels and market up -take measures, which are listed in this 
Implementation Plan and its updated version(s), but also new identified interregional and 
transnational challenges across these value chains, are within scope, including for example 
feedstock standardization, permitting fragmentation and lack of fit -for-purpose business 
models in rural regions, and using artificial intelligence as appropriate. Activities should draw 
from the detailed R&I activities program of the Implementation Plan of the SET Plan Action 
Renewable Fuels and Bioenergy (Annex I) regarding development, demonstration (also at 
pilot scale) and scale-up of 
• Advanced liquid and gaseous biofuels 173  through biochemical / thermochemical/ 
chemical conversion from sustainable biomass and/or from autotrophic microorganisms 
and primary renewable energy. 
• Other renewable liquid and gaseous fuels 174 (with particular attention to direct solar and 
algae-based fuels but excluding hydrogen as end -product) through thermochemical/ 
chemical /biochemical /electrochemical transformation of energy neutral carriers (like 
CO2 or N2) with renewable energy. 
• Solid, liquid and gaseous intermediate bioenergy carriers through biochemical / 
thermochemical/ chemical conversion from sustainable biomass and further upgrading to 
advanced biofuels  
taking into account the input defined in this context by the Implementation Working Group on 
Renewable Fuels and Bioenergy, the European Technology and Innovation Platform on 
Bioenergy (ETIP Bioenergy), the European Energy Research Alliance (EERA) Bioenergy 
Joint Programme and the SET Plan Direct Solar Fuel forum as its SRIA becomes available. 
The action may support networking and coordination, research and innovation, pilot actions, 
market uptake measures, training and mobility, awareness raising and communication, and 
dissemination and exploitation across an entire value chain of renewable fuel technologies, 
thus providing the highest possible flexibility for activities in supporting the related 
challenges. The action should establish a joint comprehensive plan of activities. The range of 
activities supported should include an appropriate set of research projects, demonstration 
projects, technology transfer projects and other activities. 
 
The activities carried out through FSTP calls can pertain to any of the research and innovation 
areas listed above in scope. The applicants must clearly describe in their proposal the 
objectives and the expected results of the FSTP call. 
The FSTP calls should take into account the provisions on ‘financial support to third parties’ 
set out in Annex B of the General Annexes and incorporate them into the proposal. 
The FSTP calls should consider specifically elements within the FSTP schemes to address 
broad EU geographical balance. 
The FSTP calls should be open to any public or private entities, including SMEs 
The consortium is expected to ensure that eligibility for financial support to third parties is 
extended to participants established in any EU Member States and Associated Countries. 
Applicants are advised to consult the European Commission’s guidance on FSTP activities175. 
Inclusiveness of a broad range of EU Member States and Associated Countries is expected, 
aiming at involving also partners coming from Eastern Europe who could enable solutions, 
thus strengthening their engagement in the SET Plan. Participation of public interest legal 
entities such as state, and notably regional and local authorities, which may have particular 
interest in regional development of renewable fuel value chains, is encouraged. 
Implementation of the action should profit from and capitalize the expertise in collaborating 
and networking of the relevant R&D programmes of national governments of the ERA -NET-
Bioenergy network176 on European research cooperation and coordination related to the field 
of the SET Plan Action Renewable Fuels and Bioenergy, as well as from the EU ERA -NET 
BESTF3177. 
The action is expected to have a duration of 5 years. It is expected that the action will 
organize joint transnational calls on an annual basis and will consider ample time for the 
implementation of the co -funded projects, notably before its end. Flexibility in defining 
activities for joint calls and implementing these calls adjusted to specific needs among 
beneficiaries is encouraged while FSTP must be defined in accordance with legal application 
requirements178. Appropriate monitoring and reporting of the results is expected. 
The proposal should envisage to design and carry out coordination and clustering activities of 
the co-funded projects and also with other Horizon Europe projects of renewable fuels. These 
activities should also include synergies, communication (joint meetings), dissemination and 
exploitation and contribute to the Knowledge Community of the CETPartnership. 
Hydrogen production as end-product and heat and power production are not in scope.
