Expected Outcome: Project results are expected to contribute to all the following expected 
outcomes: 
• Availability and integration of advanced, trustworthy, energy -efficient perception 
systems, exploiting technological advancements of Generative AI (GenAI) to enhance 
situational awareness and support safe decision-making; 
• Enhanced Vulnerable Road User (VRU) safety, based on elevated, more temper -proof 
perception and understanding of their behaviour and intention predictions; 
• Enhanced robustness of CCAM systems - both on-board and on the infrastructure side - 
in critical situations due to their training, virtual testing and validation in scenarios 
generated by GenAI, complementing existing scenario databases for the testing and 
validation of CCAM systems; 
• Enhanced understanding of the relevance and limitations of using GenAI for CCAM; 
• Tools and harmonised approaches for the use of GenAI in mobility technology 
development, training and validation, as well as for systemic applications such as traffic 
management and remote control, integrating them into existing approaches.  
Scope: Pilots and demonstrations using Level 3 and 4 vehicle services face major challenges 
in perception and decision making, highlighting the necessity for low -latency solutions that 
enhance responsiveness and situational awareness in real -time operating conditions. This is 
especially relevant for driving in more complex environments like urban areas, where 
environmental variance is higher and where new scenarios can be regularly encountered. 
Furthermore, there is the need to limit the latency, bandwidth and energy use for on -board 
calculations, as well as the need to enhance the security, privacy and reliability (e.g. scene 
understanding and prediction of near -future scenario development). For rapid decision -
making in interactions with VRUs, this is essential for implementing CCAM -enabled 
solutions and ensuring scalability. 
 
At the same time, developments of sector -agnostic technologies show advancements -such as 
GenAI- that can be beneficial for CCAM. First exploratory steps can be expected from a 
project funded under HORIZON -CL5-2023-D6-01-02284 regarding the potential in the virtual 
generation of edge cases, which could be used for the development, training, virtual testing 
and validation of CCAM systems. 
Further advancements in GenAI applications specifically for the CCAM domain need to be 
developed, trained and validated 285 . Thus, proposed actions shall include approaches to 
exploit further technological advancements for CCAM. Major steps are needed to advance to 
highly advanced, ultra -safe, trustworthy and energy efficient real -time perception and 
decision-making systems for automated vehicles, specifically focusing on scalable solutions 
and the exploitation of GenAI. These advancements should leverage low latency systems or 
distributed computing resources to facilitate real -time processing, thereby improving system 
responsiveness and safety. This topic will thus contribute to the AI Continent Action Plan 286 
by fostering AI development and adoption in the automotive sector. 
Proposed actions are expected to address all the following aspects: 
• Development of tools and approaches for robust environment perception and decision 
making (at the edge, on -board, at infrastructure or back -office). These approaches shall 
aim at accelerating and advancing the reasoning of decision making, increasing the level 
of efficiency, (cyber) -security and reliability of the applications, with path planning as 
initial use case. This is to support amongst others the perception of VRUs, the prediction 
of their behaviour and their intentions, and includes data sharing approaches for CCAM 
solutions to create a larger time window for actions in near accident scenarios. The use 
of advanced GenAI, including Large Language Models (LLMs), Vision Language 
Models (VLMs) or Vision Language Action (VLAs) can significantly enhance these 
capabilities by leveraging their advanced contextual reasoning and pattern recognition. 
Furthermore, GenAI can complement existing perception systems by improving sensory 
input interpretation and providing enriched environmental contexts, which enhance 
decision-making and adaptability. 
• Scenario generation of interactions of CCAM enabled vehicles with other road users, 
which is essential for advances in validation and testing, extending existing datasets and 
scenarios as GenAI can, based on existing data, deliver variations of scenarios (e.g. 
cultural differences of road users and infrastructure variability.) 
• Integration of GenAI technologies into existing approaches (development, training and 
validation) for their further enrichment. Understanding the limits of using GenAI 
technologies as well as the benefits and develop guidelines for valid approaches for this 
integration (including consideration of gender biases and fairness to ensure AI systems 
are transparent and accountable) and providing an outlook on the uptake of the tools and 
 
approaches developed can be done for a variety of CCAM components and technologies, 
as well as for systemic applications such as traffic management and remote control. 
• Encouraging collaboration with the European Software -defined Vehicle (SDV) initiative 
by adopting existing interfaces and building blocks, and proposing new ones developed 
within the project for potential inclusion in the SDV framework.  
Proposed actions should include measures to ensure close coordination with the European 
Connected and Autonomous Vehicle Alliance (ECAVA) announced in the European 
Automotive Action Plan. 
This topic implements the co -programmed European Partnership on ‘Connected, Cooperative 
and Automated Mobility’ (CCAM). As such, projects resulting from this topic will be 
expected to report on results to the European Partnership ‘Connected, Cooperative and 
Automated Mobility’ (CCAM) in support of the monitoring of its KPIs. 
Projects funded under this topic are expected to liaise with the ADRA Partnership 287 in order 
to explore and leverage complementarities between their respective activities and findings. 
Projects resulting from this topic are expected to apply the European Common Evaluation 
Methodology (EU-CEM) for CCAM288.
