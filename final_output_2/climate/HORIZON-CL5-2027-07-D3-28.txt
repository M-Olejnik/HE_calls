HORIZON-CL5-2027-07-D3-28: Community of practice - Data-Driven Decision-Making 
in Energy 
Call: ENERGY 
Specific conditions 
Expected EU 
contribution per 
project 
The Commission estimates that an EU contribution of around EUR 6.00 
million would allow these outcomes to be addressed appropriately. 
Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of a 
proposal requesting different amounts. 
Indicative budget The total indicative budget for the topic is EUR 6.00 million. 
Type of Action Coordination and Support Actions 
Eligibility 
conditions 
The conditions are described in General Annex B. The following 
exceptions apply: 
If projects use satellite -based earth observation, positioning, navigation 
and/or related timing data and services, beneficiaries must make use of 
Copernicus and/or Galileo/EGNOS (other data and services may 
additionally be used). 
Subject to restrictions for the protection of European communication 
networks. 
Legal and 
financial set-up of 
the Grant 
Agreements 
The rules are described in General Annex G. The following exceptions 
apply: 
Eligible costs will take the form of a lump sum as defined in the 
Decision of 7 July 2021 authorising the use of lump sum contributions 
under the Horizon Europe Programme – the Framework Programme for 
Research and Innovation (2021 -2027) – and in actions under the 
Research and Training Programme of the European Atomic Energy 
Community (2021-2025) 214. 
 
 
Expected Outcome: Project results are expected to contribute to all the following expected 
outcomes: 
• Enhanced EU cooperation to generate knowledge sharing on data and analytics used for 
the planning and operation of European grids, and market integration; 
• Better EU coordination with regard to planning and simulation tools to support the 
development of electricity grids and integration of RES are made available to the 
research, academia, grid operators, and key actors in the energy value chains; 
• Coordinated processes to generate new and innovative open -source solutions, software 
modules etc. that are added to the existing and/or new repositories that support the 
development of grids and integration of high shares of RES; 
• Improved EU-wide cooperation and coordination of actions on developing and utilising 
innovative data-driven solutions for energy, including AI-powered tools. 
• Support to researchers and research organizations to maintain their research results FAIR 
(findable, accessible, interoperable, reusable) beyond research project ending and 
accommodating for technology evolution. 
• Promotion of opensource practices and collaboration across the energy sector value 
chain to foster the industrialization of shared methods and standards in and by the energy 
industry.  
Scope: Projects are expected to: 
• Facilitate the coordination and cooperation of key actors in the energy value chains (e.g. 
grid operators, research and academia, providers of technologies and solutions, energy 
suppliers, providers of energy services traded on energy markets, representatives of 
consumers) to build a community of practice focused on developing and maintaining key 
tools and technologies for using data and analytics in planning, operating and 
maintaining the European electricity grids, while actively managing high shares of RES 
in the system; 
• Involve, cooperate with, and/or build synergies with major European and international 
initiatives and groupings that are active in this field; 
• Create a European ecosystem of innovation hubs that bring together key stakeholders in 
the energy sector to collaborate on digitalization projects, providing a space for 
experimentation and agile innovation; 
• Showcase targeted cooperation between grid operators and research & academia for
implementing specific projects and/or programmes;  
• Build blueprints, methodologies, and repositories of open -source solutions for enhanced 
simulations, observation, forecasting, infrastructure asset management, and decision -
making in energy with a view to reduce the overall costs of system operation; 
• Promote the use of modern solutions, such as digital twins and AI-enabled systems.   
Selected projects are expected to contribute to the BRIDGE initiative 215  and actively 
participate in its activities.
