HORIZON-CL5-2026-11-D3-23: Data sharing to support the training and development 
of AI foundation models in the energy sector 
Call: ENERGY 
Specific conditions 
Expected EU 
contribution per 
project 
The Commission estimates that an EU contribution of around EUR 
10.00 million would allow these outcomes to be addressed 
appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and 
selection of a proposal requesting different amounts. 
Indicative budget The total indicative budget for the topic is EUR 30.00 million. 
Type of Action Innovation Actions 
Eligibility conditions The conditions are described in General Annex B. The following 
exceptions apply: 
If projects use satellite -based earth observation, positioning, 
navigation and/or related timing data and services, beneficiaries must 
make use of Copernicus and/or Galileo/EGNOS (other data and 
services may additionally be used). 
Technology 
Readiness Level 
Activities are expected to achieve TRL 7-8 by the end of the project – 
see General Annex B. Activities may start at any TRL. 
Legal and financial 
set-up of the Grant 
Agreements 
The rules are described in General Annex G. The following 
exceptions apply: 
The granting authority may, up to 4 years after the end of the action, 
object to a transfer of ownership or to the exclusive licensing of 
results, as set out in the specific provision of Annex 5. 
 
Expected Outcome : Projects are expected to contribute to all the following expected 
outcomes: 
• Effective and innovative methods for gathering, sharing and using large data sets in 
energy applications for the purpose of training AI models while ensuring privacy and 
security. 
• Advanced and - wherever possible - open-source AI foundation models to support the 
digitalisation of the energy system, through improved grid observability, forecasting of 
supply and demand, advanced storage and renewables integration, demand side 
flexibility and energy efficiency. 
• Enhanced cooperation, knowledge sharing and interoperability among energy system 
actors for secure and seamless data exchange. 
• Advanced methodologies for AI model development ensuring that the results are FAIR 
(Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) beyond the project ending, open source 
and accommodating for technology evolution.   
Scope: The quality of AI models depends strongly on the amount, quality, and 
representativeness of the data used for their training. Projects are expected to focus on 
developing, training and testing AI foundation models, using extensive data sets to accelerate 
the energy transition in key focus areas of the energy sector. Projects are expected to: 
• Building on the results of previously funded projects on the Common European energy 
data space 205  as well as the ongoing work within the Data 4 Energy expert group, 
projects are expected to demonstrate innovative methods and data governance strategies 
for sharing data among various energy actors. Projects are expected to demonstrate that 
they have access to large relevant datasets at the time of submitting the proposal. 
• Projects are expected to develop innovative strategies for sharing data in an effective, 
secure and transparent way to support the development of AI foundation models. An 
indicative non exhaustive list of strategies that can be explored is the use of data space 
connectors or federated training of models to allow the integration of confidential data; 
the creation of synthetic data as an intermediate step to fill data gaps or improve the 
quality of the data could also be explored. Projects could also explore other innovative 
data sharing strategies, such as an ‘AI gym’. The data governance strategies that will be 
developed in the project should be designed in a way to be scalable and operational even 
after the end of the project. 
• Projects are expected to develop foundation models tailored for the energy sector, 
addressing at least one -or more- of the following use cases: planning and operation of 
electricity grids (including static power flow modelling and dynamic EMT modelling), 
forecasting, congestion management, anomaly detection, fault diagnosis, predictive 
maintenance, flexibility management, demand -side energy efficiency, smart and 
bidirectional charging of EVs or other use cases that contribute to the objective of 
digitalisation of the energy system. 
• Projects are expected to perform in-depth testing and validation of developed foundation 
models in lab demonstrators and real -life pilots, building on the results and using the 
facilities of previously funded projects on “AI testing and experimentation facilities 
(TEFs)” 206 . Regulatory sandboxes could also be considered for real -life pilot 
implementations. 
• Projects are expected to bring together a wide group of stakeholders including data 
owners (for example energy utilities, grid operators, asset owners), application 
developers (for example startups, SMEs, hyperscalers) and model deployers (for 
 
example industry, grid operators, equipment manufacturers) providing a space of 
cooperation and collaborative data exchange. 
• To scale up the training and development of the models, projects can benefit from the 
computing capacity of the AI factories that were recently announced by the European 
Commission207, in particular the three AI factories that aim to develop AI applications 
for the energy sector. 
• AI models are expected to respect ethical, safety and security principles; furthermore, 
transparency, explainability, and accountability should be embedded by design in the 
model development. Open -source development practices should be pursued wherever 
feasible. Efforts should be made to avoid biases, ensuring that the data produced is 
representative of diverse populations.  
Selected projects are expected to contribute to the BRIDGE initiative 208  and actively 
participate in its activities.
