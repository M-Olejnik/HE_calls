HORIZON-CL5-2027-02-D3-15: Production technologies for solar photovoltaics beyond 
the state-of-the-art (EUPI-PV Partnership) 
Call: BATTERIES and ENERGY 
Specific conditions 
Expected EU 
contribution per 
project 
The Commission estimates that an EU contribution of around EUR 
12.00 million would allow these outcomes to be addressed 
appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and 
selection of a proposal requesting different amounts. 
Indicative budget The total indicative budget for the topic is EUR 36.00 million. 
Type of Action Innovation Actions 
Eligibility conditions The conditions are described in General Annex B. The following 
exceptions apply: 
If projects use satellite -based earth observation, positioning, 
navigation and/or related timing data and services, beneficiaries must 
make use of Copernicus and/or Galileo/EGNOS (other data and 
services may additionally be used). 
Technology 
Readiness Level 
Activities are expected to achieve TRL 7 by the end of the project – 
see General Annex B. Activities may start at any TRL. 
Legal and financial 
set-up of the Grant 
Agreements 
The rules are described in General Annex G. The following 
exceptions apply: 
The granting authority may, up to 4 years after the end of the action, 
object to a transfer of ownership or to the exclusive licensing of 
results, as set out in the specific provision of Annex 5. 
 
Expected Outcome : The REPowerEU plan and the EU Solar Energy Strategy introduced 
targets for the deployment of solar PV amounting to 600 GWac by 2030. Complying with 
these targets will be crucial for the European Union to reach its climate targets and free itself 
from import dependency on fossil fuels and the costs this imposes on Europe’s 
competitiveness in terms of high energy prices. The Solar Strategy also introduces a target, 
which has been enshrined into the Net-Zero Industry Act, to re-consolidate the European solar 
manufacturing sector and scale up European manufacturing capacity across the entire value 
chain to at least 40% of the EU’s annual deployment needs, or 30 GW of annual capacity by 
2030. Innovation is particularly important in the solar PV sector, which is characterised by a 
short technology cycle, where new technologies become mainstream in only a few years. 
Novel technologies offer therefore the opportunity to innovative start -ups and scale -ups to 
manufacture and put on the market competitive and efficient PV products, strengthening the 
resilience of the EU PV value chain thus reducing excessive dependencies and increasing 
security. 
Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes:    
1. Increase the potential for commercialisation of innovative PV technologies creating a 
competitive technological know-how for the European PV industrial base; 
2. Contribute to the objectives of the EU Solar PV Industry Alliance; 
3. Support the execution of the solar energy joint research and innovation agenda.   
Scope: Proposals are expected to demonstrate 
• Solar cells/modules with conversion efficiencies beyond those commercially available 
and degradation/reliability and performance at least on par with the most reliable 
commercially available technologies; 
• A multi -MWp-ready resilient, energy efficient, defect -free production technology for 
cells/modules; 
• Production equipment & pilot line, including digitalised and automated processing.   
Whenever the expected exploitation of project results entails developing, creating, 
manufacturing and marketing a product or process, or in creating and providing a service, the 
plan for the exploitation and dissemination of results must include a strategy for such 
exploitation. Proposals will present a plan for the exploitation and dissemination of results 
which should include a strong business case and sound exploitation strategy. The exploitation 
plan should include preliminary plans for scalability, com mercialisation, and deployment 
(feasibility study, business plan) indicating the possible funding sources to be potentially used 
(in particular the Innovation Fund). 
This topic implements the co -programmed European Partnership for Innovation in 
Photovoltaics (EUPI -PV). As such, projects resulting from this topic will be expected to 
report on the results to the European Partnership for Innovation in Photovoltaics (EUPI -PV) 
in support of the monitoring of its KPIs.
