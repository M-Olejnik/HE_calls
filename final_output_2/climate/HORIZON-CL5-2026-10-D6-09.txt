as set out in the specific provision of Annex 5. 
Eligible costs will take the form of a lump sum as defined in the 
Decision of 7 July 2021 authorising the use of lump sum contributions 
under the Horizon Europe Programme – the Framework Programme for 
Research and Innovation (2021 -2027) – and in actions under the

Expected Outcome: Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected 
outcomes: 
 
• Implementation of the NWRSA methodology for secondary rural roads; 
• Innovative and effective enforcement strategies, incentive mechanisms and measures 
raising risk awareness for fostering safer behaviour; 
• Prevention strategies for reducing road fatalities and serious road traffic injuries on rural 
roads along with the respective implementation guidelines and policy measures tailored 
to the responsible stakeholders (regional authorities, police, healthcare professionals, 
national governments, etc.); 
• GIS-based application to assist local and regional authorities in identifying and mapping 
the impact of extreme weather phenomena and other natural disasters (such as floods, 
fires, storms, heavy snowfall etc.) on the safety and resilience of the road network in 
their jurisdiction.   
Scope: With more than 50% of all EU road fatalities occurring in rural areas along with 
evidence suggesting that crashes and crash -related fatalities in rural roads vary from those in 
urban roads or motorways, it is imperative to understand and mitigate the safety risks in rural 
roads in view of the EU’s ambition to move towards Vision Zero by 2050. Local and regional 
authorities have an important role to play to reduce road fatalities and serious injuries. 
In the EU, the Road Infrastructure Safety Management (RISM) Directive  introduced the 
concept of network-wide road safety assessment (NWRSA) and the concept of proactive road 
safety assessment through the understanding of the in-built safety of roads. Considering safety 
at the network -level allows for an overview of the road safety performance instead of 
focusing on isolated parts of it, while the in -built safety assessment aims to identify parts of 
the road that have been omitted by crash -based analyses (such crash clusters or hotspot 
analysis) as they do not concentrate the majority of crashes, yet are crash -prone and/or 
uncomfortable to navigate. According to the provisions of the RISM Directive, a 
methodology has been developed to assess the network -wide safety of motorways and 
primary rural roads based on their combined crash -based and in -built safety assessments. 
While this is a first step in understanding road safety conditions on rural roads, secondary and 
lower-class roads are not covered and, at the same time, there is not adequate information on 
road user behaviour. 
In an ageing society, cognitive and physical impairments pose an increasing threat to safe 
mobility. In rural areas, people with any kind of impairment or disability often lack 
alternatives to driving a car for their mobility needs. Addressing these issues will not only 
enhance road safety but also improve the quality of life and prevent the social exclusion of 
these people. 
In addition to road safety issues, local and regional authorities manage risks associated with 
extreme weather phenomena and other natural disasters like floods, fires, storms or heavy 
snowfall. As these may affect safety and operations, relevant authorities need to adopt a more 
holistic resilience monitoring and response. 
Research should support addressing these challenges by undertaking all the following actions 
in at least three regions covering both primary and secondary rural roads of adequate length to 
allow for region-level comparisons: 
• Demonstrate the practical applicability of the NWRSA methodology and expand its use 
to all rural roads for an easy, low -cost, flexible and transparent, yet sufficiently accurate 
assessment of road infrastructure safety. Identify information gaps and propose methods 
to leverage available data to supplement the understanding of crash causation and 
outcomes. 
• Develop prevention strategies and measures to reduce fatalities and serious injuries in 
rural areas with a focus on high -risk locations and situations and on improving road user 
behaviour. This includes the development of reliable and easy-to-use methods to provide 
quantified indications of the actual crash risk associated with and the prevalence of risky 
behaviours. Based on this, enforcement measures with evidence -based effectiveness in 
addressing the problems and motivations underlying risky behaviour should be 
proposed, combining traditional methods with innovative enforcement approaches and 
new technologies, also taking into account the issue of multi -offenders 317 . These 
enforcement measures, complemented by suitable awareness raising and nudging 
measures as well as novel incentive mechanisms to promote safe driving, will form 
building blocks to design integrated strategies fostering safer behaviour according to the 
local needs and specificities of rural areas. A gender and disability sensitive and 
intersectional approach, which intersects with other social factors, could be considered. 
Crash prevention strategies should also include countermeasures to reduce the effects of 
health-related risk factors and to guarantee at the same time the mobility of older people 
and persons with health impairments in rural areas. 
• Develop tools to make knowledge about climate -related risks easily accessible to local 
authorities and to enable them to take appropriate actions in order to maintain road safety 
and the resilience of the rural road network and of the infrastructure for road users even 
in extreme conditions318.  
Projects should select those regions ensuring diversity in terms of road network design, 
geography and climate conditions, and road safety culture. At least two of those regions 
should be in countries with higher percentage of fatalities on rural roads than the EU average. 
The involvement of road authorities is strongly recommended.
