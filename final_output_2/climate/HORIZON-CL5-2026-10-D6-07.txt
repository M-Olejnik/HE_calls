HORIZON-CL5-2026-10-D6-07: Supporting sustainable and smart urban mobility in 
Europe (CIVITAS) 
Call: BATTERIES and MOBILITY 
Specific conditions 
Expected EU The Commission estimates that an EU contribution of around EUR 4.00 
contribution per 
project 
million would allow these outcomes to be addressed appropriately. 
Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of a 
proposal requesting different amounts. 
Indicative budget The total indicative budget for the topic is EUR 4.00 million. 
Type of Action Coordination and Support Actions 
Eligibility 
conditions 
The conditions are described in General Annex B. The following 
exceptions apply: 
If projects use satellite -based earth observation, positioning, navigation 
and/or related timing data and services, beneficiaries must make use of 
Copernicus and/or Galileo/EGNOS (other data and services may 
additionally be used). 
Legal and 
financial set-up of 
the Grant 
Agreements 
The rules are described in General Annex G. The following exceptions 
apply: 
Eligible costs will take the form of a lump sum as defined in the 
Decision of 7 July 2021 authorising the use of lump sum contributions 
under the Horizon Europe Programme – the Framework Programme for 
Research and Innovation (2021 -2027) – and in actions under the 
Research and Training Programme of the European Atomic Energy 
Community (2021-2025) 305. 
 
Expected Outcome: Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following outcomes: 
• Valorisation, cross-fertilisation and dissemination of innovative solutions for sustainable 
urban mobility, from EU and national projects through the CIVITAS initiative; 
• Contribution to the accelerated deployment of innovative urban mobility solutions, 
increasing competitiveness of European urban mobility actors while achieving European 
mobility policy objectives. 
• Cities are equipped with a relevant knowledge, necessary soft and technical skills to 
successfully deploy smart and sustainable mobility solutions, for passenger and freight. 
• A vibrant community of urban innovative mobility stakeholders is maintained and 
strengthened.   
Scope: Effective and efficient urban mobility systems are the backbone of competitive cities, 
without them the economy comes to a standstill. While cities are going through a rapid digital, 
green and social transformation, local and regional authorities play bigger roles and take on 
 
greater responsibilities in contributing to the prosperity, climate -neutrality and 
competitiveness of the European Union. 
However, the deployment of innovative sustainable mobility solutions has been hampered by 
fragmentation of the support to cities at regional, national and EU level, lack of resources for 
experimentation with new approaches, insufficient knowledge on research results and 
innovative solutions, and difficulties for urban stakeholders to exchange knowledge, 
experiences and lessons learned, including providing feedback to policy makers and the 
research community. 
The aim of this coordination and support action is to address the barriers to the deployment of 
innovative urban mobility projects’ results through a comprehensive and collaborative 
approach, while further strengthening the European urban mobility innovation ecosystem. 
Taking into account the previous CIVITAS coordination and support action 306 , in 
collaboration with, and avoiding overlaps with, the Cities Mission Platform 307  and other 
relevant initiatives, the action is expected to address - in a clear and streamlined approach - all 
of the following aspects: 
• Harvesting and spreading innovative urban mobility solutions, and speeding up the take -
up of the related projects results by European cities by:        
 setting up capacity building and a replication programme, to facilitate twinning, 
mutual learning and peer-to-peer exchanges, which should include cooperation with 
industry, SMEs and start-ups, while ensuring a feedback to policy loop;    
 optimising the common, user -friendly CIVITAS project evaluation framework, 
with dedicated support for its implementation by the projects that are part of the 
CIVITAS initiative;    
 optimising and promoting the CIVITAS website as the main knowledge and 
exchange platform for the European urban mobility community by means of digital 
tools and structured management approaches to disseminate information about the 
EU’s urban mobility research and innovation developments and results.   
• Developing and strengthening the urban mobility community in the EU and Associated 
Countries and actively engaging stakeholders across sectors and governance levels to 
facilitate common learning and exchange by:         
 facilitating and supporting the Educational and Youth network,    
 facilitating and optimising the support to national CIVITAS networks (CIVINETS),    
 supporting R&I projects’ clustering, and the coordination of living lab activities,    
 
 organising the CIVITAS Forum, and supporting the organisation of the Urban 
Mobility Days,    
 under guidance of the Commission services, organising the CIVITAS Politicians 
Exchange Forum,    
 facilitating the exchange between cities, urban public transport authorities and the 
industry, SMEs and start-ups,    
 enlarging the CIVITAS network.   
Since 2002 CIVITAS acts as an open platform that facilitates research, the uptake of 
innovative solutions, the validation of research results, the exchange of knowledge and best 
practices, and common learning in the area of urban mobility and transport. The project 
selected under this topic will help to ensure the long -term support for the R&I urban mobility 
projects offering governance, and an organisational and logistical framework that guarantees 
the wide dissemination and take up of urban mobility project results.
