HORIZON-CL5-2027-06-D6-12: Support for dissemination events in the field of 
Transport Research 
Call: MOBILITY 
Specific conditions 
Expected EU 
contribution per 
project 
The Commission estimates that an EU contribution of around EUR 1.60 
million would allow these outcomes to be addressed appropriately. 
Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of a 
proposal requesting different amounts. 
Indicative budget The total indicative budget for the topic is EUR 1.60 million. 
Type of Action Coordination and Support Actions 
Eligibility 
conditions 
The conditions are described in General Annex B. The following 
exceptions apply: 
If projects use satellite -based earth observation, positioning, navigation 
and/or related timing data and services, beneficiaries must make use of 
Copernicus and/or Galileo/EGNOS (other data and services may 
additionally be used). 
Legal and 
financial set-up of 
the Grant 
Agreements 
The rules are described in General Annex G. The following exceptions 
apply: 
Eligible costs will take the form of a lump sum as defined in the 
Decision of 7 July 2021 authorising the use of lump sum contributions 
under the Horizon Europe Programme – the Framework Programme for 
Research and Innovation (2021 -2027) – and in actions under the 
Research and Training Programme of the European Atomic Energy 
Community (2021-2025) 321. 
 
Expected Outcome: Project’s results are expected to contribute to all the following expected 
outcomes:    
1. Successful Transport Research Arena conference (TRA) in 2030; 
2. Conference papers published in proceedings and in a recognised scientific journal; 
3. Higher visibility, political and strategic relevance of the transport sector and of the EU 
policy in the field; 
4. Enhanced dissemination, communication and valorisation of transport R&I objectives, 
perspectives, strategies and results; 
5. More effective links and exchanges between research and innovation stakeholders, 
industry and policy makers, to support the development and deployment of innovative 
solutions in Europe and Associated Countries; 
6. Increased attractiveness of transport related studies and reinforce the pursuit of 
excellence in European transport research and innovation, by giving recognition and 
visibility to the best achievements; 
7. Successful organisation of a series of awards in transport research and innovation to 
recognise excellence of young and senior researchers, covering all transport modes and 
cross-cutting issues; 
8. Increased visibility, interest and number of applications for the two competitions for 
transport research and innovation awards.   
Scope: The action will prepare and provide support to the Transport Research Arena (TRA) 
conference to be organised in 2030 gathering transport stakeholders for discussing political, 
industrial and research issues on a European and global level. 
 
In line with previous TRA biennial conferences, the event should address the technological 
and industrial developments of the transport sector (i.e. road, rail, waterborne, aviation sectors 
and cross -modal aspects) providing a high level, future -oriented perspective coming from 
politics, the industry and the research community, in response to Europe’s social and 
competitiveness needs and expectations. Specific attention should be put on a broad and 
balanced participation in the conference i.e., students, young researchers, women, under -
represented groups, many country representatives, etc. 
The action will be implemented in close collaboration with the Management and Programme 
Committees of the TRA, which includes the European Commission services, the different 
European Technology Platforms (ERTRAC for road, ERRAC for rail, WATERBORNE TP 
for waterborne, ALICE for logistics and ACARE for aeronautics and ECTP for construction), 
the Conference of European Directors of Roads (CEDR), the European Transport Research 
Alliance (ETRA) and the previous TRA conference organiser (TRA 2028) in order to 
maintain continuity of the event. 
Proposals should address all the following aspects: 
• Demonstrate the financial and organisational capacity of the national authorities 
interested to host the event and provide an economic plan covering the potential 
additional funding needs; 
• Describe the involvement of the Member State holding the Presidency of the European 
Union in year 2030 to better ensure a high political and strategic relevance; 
• Support the definition of the overall planning of the conference, including the main 
thematic pillars of the event as well as the structuring of the technical and political 
sessions; 
• Contribute to the identification and selection of an appropriate conference venue, support 
the organisation of the conference’s logistics and include a Professional Conference 
Organiser (PCO) in the consortium; 
• Provide operational support to the TRA conference, such as in relation to the website 
and conference management IT tools (e.g. for the registration of participants, handling of 
speakers’ contributions, submission and selection of scientific papers, conference 
application); 
• Support the organisation of the demonstration activities and technical visits; 
• Assess and monitor the environmental impact of the event and propose appropriate 
measures to reduce and mitigate this impact; 
• Organise of high -quality awards series for transport research and innovation awards 
(TRA VISIONS) covering all transport modes and cross -cutting issues including 
technological, socio -economic, and behavioural aspects, in line with the EU policy 
objectives for digitalisation and climate-neutral and environmentally friendly mobility:        
 An award stream for students and young researchers with the goal of stimulating 
the interest among young researchers/students to develop innovative solutions in 
the field of transport;    
 An award stream for senior researchers in the field of innovative transport concepts 
based on results from EU -funded projects only. This will include in addition, a 
special honorary award as a recognition of outstanding and well -recognised 
contribution to transport-related research and innovation of a senior researcher who 
is about to complete or has completed his/her career.   
• Involve the awarded researchers in the conference programme and promote links 
between the researchers and possible career development opportunities in the field (e.g. 
traineeships, jobs, courses, training); 
• Foresee a very good media coverage and dissemination activities before, during and after 
the event for both the TRA conference and for the TRA VISIONS. A mechanism should 
be put in place to clearly track outreach efforts and evaluate their impact.
