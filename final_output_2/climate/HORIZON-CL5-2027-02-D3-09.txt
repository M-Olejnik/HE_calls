HORIZON-CL5-2027-02-D3-09: Innovative technologies and solutions to improve wave 
and tidal energy systems 
Call: BATTERIES and ENERGY 
Specific conditions 
Expected EU 
contribution per 
project 
The Commission estimates that an EU contribution of around EUR 
43.00 million would allow these outcomes to be addressed 
appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and 
selection of a proposal requesting different amounts. 
Indicative budget The total indicative budget for the topic is EUR 43.00 million. 
Type of Action Innovation Actions 
Admissibility 
conditions 
The conditions are described in General Annex A. The following 
exceptions apply: 
Due to the complexity of the topic, the page limit for proposals is 
increased to 60 pages. 
Eligibility 
conditions 
The conditions are described in General Annex B. The following 
exceptions apply: 
If projects use satellite -based earth observation, positioning, navigation 
and/or related timing data and services, beneficiaries must make use of 
Copernicus and/or Galileo/EGNOS (other data and services may 
additionally be used). 
Technology 
Readiness Level 
Activities are expected to achieve TRL 6 -7 by the end of the project – 
see General Annex B. Activities may start at any TRL. 
Legal and financial 
set-up of the Grant 
Agreements 
The rules are described in General Annex G. The following exceptions 
apply: 
Beneficiaries must provide financial support to third parties (FSTP). 
The support to third parties can only be provided in the form of grants. 
The maximum amount to be granted to each third party is EUR 
800.000. This is necessary to appropriately conduct the activities in 
scope of this topic, namely, to contribute to the development and 
validation of costly and complex components and expected to include 
high capital intensive and labour -intensive activities. These activities 
are as well labour intensive and  need specialised skills. As the topic 
envisages subsequent FSTP calls to progressively develop a given 
solution, the maximum amount to be granted to each party needs to be 
sufficiently high to cater cases where a given legal entity may receive 
more than one FSTP grant.  
 
Expected Outcome : Project results are expected to contribute to all following expected 
outcomes: 
• Advance in the realisation of the Strategic Energy Technology (SET) Plan’s research and 
innovation priorities and targets for ocean energy; 
• Energy producers and consumers benefit from increased performance of wave and tidal 
energy technologies with the focus on efficiency and flexibility, reduced cost, improved 
reliability and sustainability, operation and maintenance, robustness and security during 
all stages of the lifetime of an ocean energy farm from installation, operation and 
maintenance to decommissioning; 
• Efficient and effective support to ocean energy research and innovation through 
alignment and cooperation among different actors, avoiding fragmentation of efforts 
providing effectively a significant developmental boost of wave and tidal energy 
technologies. 
• Increased contribution of ocean energy to the energy system, with minimal impacts on 
health and the environment (notably biodiversity) and at the lowest possible cost.  
Scope: The action contributes to address the Strategic Energy Technology (SET) Plan’s 
research and innovation priorities 179 and targets 180 for ocean energy focussing on wave and 
tidal energy development. It will take into account the input defined in this context by the 
Implementation Working Group on ocean energy (IWG ocean), the European Technology and 
Innovation Platform on ocean energy (ETIP Ocean) 181 and the European Energy Research 
Alliance (EERA) joint programme on ocean energy182. 
The overarching objective is the development and demonstration of cost -effective wave and 
tidal energy systems that can survive in a harsh ocean or sea environment with minimal 
impacts on health and the environment and biodiversity. The challenge is open to proposals 
seeking to steer wave and tidal energy development for different type of resources in an 
effective way at a European level and to bring these technologies to the market. In this action 
the following can be considered: 
• The development and demonstration in controlled environment of innovative wave 
energy devices. 
• The development and demonstration in controlled environment of innovative next 
generation tidal energy devices 
• The development and demonstration of new sustainable materials in ocean energy 
converters, moorings and foundations whilst ensuring structural integrity, durability and 
circularity can be considered. 
 
• The development and demonstration of sustainable tailored mooring and connection of 
electrical or other power transmission systems (cable system, electrical equipment, ....) 
for wave and tidal energy devices. Advance combined mooring and electrical connectors 
or hydraulic power transmission to reduce component cost and number of connection 
operations, included in systems for sharing an anchor between devices in arrays. 
Develop novel systems for safe and quick connection/disconnection that do not require 
large vessels and/or diving teams. 
• The instrumentation for condition monitoring and predictive maintenance of ocean 
energy devices and structures. Apply recent advances in condition and structural health 
monitoring from other sectors to ocean energy. The use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in 
ocean energy technology development. 
• Advanced manufacturing of ocean energy devices and structures and auxiliary 
equipment considering reduced energy, manufacturing costs and materials consumption, 
high production throughput and optimization of logistics. 
• Development of technologies and solutions for the installation, maintenance and 
decommissioning of wave and tidal energy devices.  
The validation and demonstration of new ocean energy technologies should be done in a 
controlled environment meaning that this is done under monitored and reproducible 
conditions, using for instance, test rigs and test tanks, semi -enclosed basins, or dedicated real-
sea demonstration sites with instrumented monitoring infrastructure. 
Structure, breakdown of activities and budget allocation 
The action consists of activities directly implemented by the consortium and activities 
implemented through financial support to third parties. The latter can include cooperation 
with the activities undertaken by the beneficiaries of the EU grant and may complement them. 
The R&I activities are divided into three challenges:   
1. Breakthrough challenge 
2. Validation challenge 
3. Demonstration challenge  
The breakthrough and the validation challenge can be carried out both through activities 
directly implemented by the core consortium and through FSTP activities. The demonstration 
challenge will solely be implemented by the core consortium. 
The breakthrough challenge entails actions to develop new solutions, tools and new 
knowledge to increase the competitiveness of the ocean energy sector and on the acceleration 
of ocean energy deployment at scale. The aim is that the innovative technologies have been at 
least validated towards the end of the project. 
The validation challenge entail actions to validate technologies, tools and innovative solutions 
both in a laboratory and in a relevant environment which have been developed in the project 
or have been developed previously or separately in other European and national projects. 
FSTP can be used for new illustrative application use -cases demonstrating well defined added 
value to end users. 
In the demonstration challenge the consortium is expected to carry out demonstration 
activities (up to TRL 7) in line with the priorities set by the SET Plan ocean energy R&I 
priorities and targets and accelerate the take up of innovation by the industry. The 
demonstration activities will be selected using the stage gate approach developed by the IEA 
OES task 12183. 
Activities directly implemented by the core consortium 
The activities of the core consortium are expected to include direct research and innovation 
activities in any of the areas listed in scope and in any of the challenges (breakthrough, 
validation, demonstration). The core consortium will be responsible for the management of 
the whole project, including the actions carried out through financial support to third parties 
(management of the FSTP calls, management of the FSTP projects). 
It is expected that the budget dedicated to the project management will not exceed 7% of the 
EU funding. 
The project is expected to carry out at least three demonstration activities. The focus of each 
demonstration activity should be clearly different from each other. The project is expected to 
include a clear go/no go milestone for each demonstration activity before entering the 
deployment phase. Before this go/no-go milestone, the project has to show evidence of having 
in place i) all needed permits for deployment, ii) complete, detailed and realistic engineering 
plans compliant with the applicable standards, and iv) a complete business and 
implementation plan. The proposal is expected to present a clear and convincing pathway to 
obtain necessary permits for the demonstration activities and allow for appropriate timelines 
to achieve these, while demonstrating how it will get a financial close for each demonstration 
activity. For this the use of other EU/national/regional support mechanisms can be considered. 
The total maximum amount of EU funding for the activities in the demonstration challenge is 
expected to be 24 million Euros. 
Activities implemented through Financial Support to Third Parties (FSTP) 
A share of the EU funding will be implemented through financial support to third parties and 
used to engage research organizations, academia, start -ups, scale-ups, SME’s, industries and 
other entities and to enable use-cases that are not yet identified in the proposal stage. 
The use of financial support to third parties should allow a faster implementation of research 
and innovation activities, and to respond to disruptive developments, attracting different 
 
stakeholders and innovators. A tiered approach to address complex R&I challenges should be 
adopted via FSTP calls, meaning that projects with a relatively short duration should be 
supported (e.g. 12-18 months). A given action supported by FSTP can be implemented by one 
third party or a by a (small) consortium of entities. Subsequent FSTP calls can be used to give 
further support to successful projects initiatives. The calls should be planned carefully and 
ensure that successful R&I work can continue without major interruption. 
For the FSTP calls that are related to the breakthrough challenge and the validation challenge, 
the following considerations should be taken into account: 
• Breakthrough challenge: The proposal should foresee consecutive FSTP calls for the 
development of breakthrough technologies and innovative solutions in support of 
demonstrating and upscaling wave and tidal energy considering the full supply chain. Up 
to 3 million EU requested contribution should be used to set up this ‘Breakthrough 
technologies’ challenge for third parties. The challenge should aim at attracting new 
partners (academia, SMEs, scale ups) and solutions. 
• Validation challenge: The proposal should foresee consecutive FSTP calls for the 
validation of innovative technologies/solutions developed in the breakthrough challenge 
or from earlier R&I projects. Up to 6 million EUR EU funding is expected to be used for 
subsequent FSTP calls. FSTP will be used to engage other entities not earlier identified.  
The first FSTP call for the breakthrough challenge should be published in the first year of the 
project. The FSTP call for the validation challenge should be published in a later stage of the 
project enabling the use of the results of the breakthrough challenge and/or the core R&I 
activities. 
The activities carried out through FSTP calls can pertain to any of the research and innovation 
areas listed in scope. The applicants must clearly describe in their proposal the objectives and 
the expected results of the FSTP call. 
For the FSTP calls, the consortium is expected to take into account the provisions on 
‘financial support to third parties’ set out in Annex B of the General Annexes and incorporate 
them into the proposal. The consortium should consider specifically elements within the FSTP 
schemes to address broad EU geographical balance. 
The FSTP calls should be open to any public or private entities, including SMEs. 
Applicants are advised to consult the European Commission’s guidance on FSTP activities184 
Governance of the project 
The action will require a strong internal governance and strong procedures. In the project 
proposal, the consortium will have to describe all challenges/actions for the whole duration of 
the project, including the activities to be carried out directly by the core consortium and the 
 
ones carried out through financial support to third parties (FSTP). It will have to set out how 
and the calls for proposals to be funded through financial support to third parties (FSTP) are 
organised and how the evaluation of these proposals is carried out. The core project 
consortium needs to define the selection criteria and the process and criteria of organisations, 
for which financial support may be granted, ensuring compliance with the FSTP rules under 
Horizon Europe. The proposal should describe clearly the methodology to implement the 
various steps of the FSTP calls, define the specifications of the stages of the competitions, 
timelines, targets, KPIs and a solid evaluation methodology including evaluation criteria. The 
consortium is also responsible for ensuring high visibility of the FSTP calls. 
The core consortium is expected to demonstrate proven experience in sound financial 
management of large projects, including public procurement and/or calls and grants to support 
third parties, in particular for the beneficiaries that will manage the FSTP calls. 
The project must, for all the research and innovation activities, including the FSTP actions, 
embed mechanisms to assess and demonstrate progress following the stage gate metrics 
developed by Task 12 of the IEA Ocean Energy System Technology Collaboration Platform 
(with qualitative and quantitative KPIs, benchmarking and progress monitoring and share 
communicable results with the European R&D community. The evaluation framework has 
already been introduced by the Europewave PCP action. 
The project should report the progress of all its R&I activities according to these mechanisms 
and KPIs with an annual deliverable and milestone for the project execution according to 
plan. 
The consortium will have to present a comprehensive risk and mitigation plan. In this plan 
special attention should be paid to the risk that the chosen demonstration actions will not 
reach a go-decision. 
Besides defining and tracking progress of technology -specific KPIs in the technology areas 
specifically covered, the project should monitor and report on the contribution towards the 
high-level SET Plan KPIs defined by the SET Plan community in the ocean energy sector. 185 
These annual reviews will be defined as milestones of the project and, as such, they will be 
subject to the approval of the granting authority. 
The project sets up an Advisory Board, composed of experts in ocean energy systems’ 
research and innovation, representing public and private entities that are independent from the 
beneficiaries of the project. A representation of the SET Plan Implementation Working Group 
(IWG) on Ocean Energy, the Clean Energy Transition Cofund Partnership (CET Partnership) 
related initiative, and of the European Commission should be as well part of the Advisory 
Board. The Advisory Board advised the project to ensure coherence and alignment with the 
SET plan activities. The consortium will ensure that the advice of the Advisory Board is 
appropriately taken into account in the project’s implementation. This will be monitored by 
the granting authority. 
 
The consortium should define measures to maximise the impact of the successful project and 
for that will contribute to the relevant Knowledge Community and Impact Network of the 
Clean Energy Transition Partnership and share communicable results with the European R&D 
community. 
For activities in line with relevant initiatives under the International Energy Agency 
Technology Collaboration Programme on Ocean Energy Systems (IEA TCP OES) 186 , 
proposals should envisage liaising with these initiatives to consider possible synergies, 
cooperation and mutual sharing of knowledge. 
Proposals are encouraged to consider, where relevant, services offered by European research 
infrastructures110, especially the Marinerg -i distributed infrastructure specialising in sea 
applications., as well as related projects offering access research infrastructures in the ocean 
energy applications, such as RISEnergy (https://risenergy-project.eu)187. 
Duration 
The estimated project duration is around 5 years.
