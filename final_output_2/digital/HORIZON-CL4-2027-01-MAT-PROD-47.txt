HORIZON-CL4-2027-01-MAT-PROD-47: Pilot access schemes to Technology 
Infrastructures for European startups, scaleups and innovative SMEs (CSA) 
Call: INDUSTRY 
Specific conditions 
Expected EU 
contribution per 
project 
The Commission estimates that an EU contribution of between EUR 
1.50 and 2.50 million would allow these outcomes to be addressed 
appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and 
selection of a proposal requesting different amounts. 
Indicative budget The total indicative budget for the topic is EUR 5.00 million. 
Type of Action Coordination and Support Actions 
Legal and financial 
set-up of the Grant 
Agreements 
The rules are described in General Annex G. The following exceptions 
apply: 
The granting authority may, up to 4 years after the end of the action, 
object to a transfer of ownership or to the exclusive licensing of results, 
as set out in the specific provision of Annex 5. 
Eligible costs will take the form of a lump sum as defined in the 
Decision of 7 July 2021 authorising the use of lump sum contributions 
under the Horizon Europe Programme – the Framework Programme for 
Research and Innovation (2021 -2027) – and in actions under the 
Research and Training Programme of the European Atomic Energy 
Community (2021-2025) 56. 
 
Expected Outcome: Proposals should demonstrate the following expected outcomes: 
• A sound understanding of the specific needs of industrial users (including but not limited 
to innovative SMEs, startups and scaleups) for Technology infrastructure services in 
specific priority areas including but not limited to advanced materials, clean energy, or 
health and biotechnology; 
 
• Increased opportunities for industrial users for development, testing, up -scaling and 
deployment of new technologies via the use of services offered by Technology 
Infrastructures; 
• Strengthened innovation and technology development capacity of European SMEs, 
startups and scaleups via improved access to Technology Infrastructures; 
• Attractiveness and effectiveness of the developed access schemes for broadening the 
range of Technology Infrastructures users, especially for startups and scaleups, including 
with transnational access.  
Scope: Startups, scaleups and other innovative SMEs require access to state -of-the-art 
research and technology facilities, equipment and expertise to test, upscale, validate new 
products and technologies, shortening the time -to-market and increasing the chances for a 
successful commercialisation. Access mechanisms to Technology Infrastructures as well as 
access contracts and collaboration or service provision agreements are often complex, while 
the costs of using such infrastructures can significantly surpass the financial capacities of 
growing innovative companies. 
The action will develop and test pilot multi -site access schemes for startups, scaleups and 
other innovative SMEs, involving a critical mass of Technology Infrastructures operators and 
users in priority areas (including but not limited to advanced materials, clean energy, or health 
and biotechnology). It should build on existing initiatives with already developed single 
access points to a comprehensive set of facilities and services in a selected technology area, 
like for example Open Innovation Test Beds or other integrated networks, that allow for a 
quick deployment of a common access scheme. 
The action should include setting-up a pilot centrally managed and funded access programme, 
allowing companies quick access to the needed services, with simplified and standardised 
access conditions applicable across the EU, to be coordinated and in line with the work on the 
envisaged European Charter of access for industrial users to research and technology 
infrastructures. While the focus shall be the provision of access and support services to 
companies, the action can also include enhancing the accessibility and usability of technology 
infrastructure services to ensure that they meet the evolving needs of users. 
The action should aim at significant broadening of the user base of the technology 
infrastructures to address the needs of startups and scaleups that do not have access to such 
facilities in their local ecosystems. To this end, proposals should include the development and 
implementation of activities to increase the visibility and promote and demonstrate the uptake 
of technology infrastructures services provided to users across the EU. 
Furthermore, proposals should aim to enhance transnational and multisite collaboration 
among Technology Infrastructures fostering the building of technology infrastructures 
ecosystems, the sharing of experience, resources, and best practices in management, service 
offer, staff exchange and networking. Proposals may also benefit, especially for 
communication and dissemination activities, from sharing best practices and taking stock of 
what other relevant projects are developing in the field of Technology Infrastructures.
