HORIZON-CL4-2026-04-DIGITAL-EMERGING-12: Standards for Quantum 
Technologies – Coordination and Support Action (CSA) 
Call: DIGITAL 
Specific conditions 
Expected EU 
contribution per 
project 
The Commission estimates that an EU contribution of around EUR 1.00 
million would allow these outcomes to be addressed appropriately. 
Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of a 
proposal requesting different amounts. 
Indicative budget The total indicative budget for the topic is EUR 1.00 million. 
Type of Action Coordination and Support Actions 
Eligibility 
conditions 
The conditions are described in General Annex B. The following 
exceptions apply: 
The conditions are described in General Annex B. The following 
 
exceptions apply: In order to achieve the expected outcomes, and 
safeguard the Union’s strategic assets, interests, autonomy, and 
security, it is important to avoid a situation of technological dependency 
on a non -EU source, in a global context that requires the EU to take 
action to build on its strengths, and to carefully assess and address any 
strategic weaknesses, vulnerabilities and high -risk dependencies which 
put at risk the attainment of its ambitions. For this reason, participation 
is limited to leg al entities established in Member States, Iceland and 
Norway, associated countries and OECD countries. 
For the duly justified and exceptional reasons listed in the paragraph 
above, in order to guarantee the protection of the strategic interests of 
the Union and its Member States, entities established in an eligible 
country listed above, but which are directly or indirectly controlled by a 
non-eligible country or a non -eligible country entity, shall not 
participate in the action. 
Legal and financial 
set-up of the Grant 
Agreements 
The rules are described in General Annex G. The following exceptions 
apply: 
Eligible costs will take the form of a lump sum as defined in the 
Decision of 7 July 2021 authorising the use of lump sum contributions 
under the Horizon Europe Programme – the Framework Programme for 
Research and Innovation (2021 -2027) – and in actions under the 
Research and Training Programme of the European Atomic Energy 
Community (2021-2025) 129. 
 
Expected Outcome: This action will support and accelerate the development and adoption of 
European and international standards for quantum technologies, enhancing interoperability 
quality/reliability assurance, and trust in quantum systems. It will strengthen Europe's 
leadership in the global quantum standardisation landscape and ensure that European 
industrial and research priorities are well represented and integrated into emerging standards. 
Expected outcomes include: 
• Delivery of concrete, EU -relevant pre-normative standards and technical specifications 
across quantum computing, communication, and sensing. 
• Substantial contribution of European stakeholders, notably SMEs and start -ups in 
international standardisation bodies (e.g., ISO/IEC, ITU -T, ETSI), with alignment to EU 
industrial strategies. 
 
• Promotion of cross -sectoral interoperability through standardised interfaces, control 
protocols, reliability in operating conditions and benchmarking methodologies, reducing 
market fragmentation and technical barriers. 
• Creation of practical support tools such as user guidelines, training modules, and best 
practices to accelerate the uptake and implementation of quantum standards.  
Scope: The CSA will coordinate and support standardisation activities for quantum 
technologies in areas such as quantum computing, communication, sensing, and control. 
Proposals should include: 
• Build on the roadmaps of European standardisation organisations to (i) standardise 
results from quantum projects funded under Horizon Europe, the Digital Europe 
Programme, and EuroHPC JU in line with stakeholder priorities, and (ii) foster an active 
industrial standardisation community to promote engagement and uptake within the 
European quantum industry. 
• Enabling broad stakeholder participation in international standardisation activities (e.g. 
ISO/IEC, ITU-T, ETSI), promoting EU priorities. 
• Support interoperability and integration of quantum systems through standardisation of 
interfaces, protocols, and benchmarking methodologies. 
• Develop explanatory documentation and training material to facilitate adoption and 
implementation of the developed standards. 
• Drafting and developing concrete standards or technical specifications, in cooperation 
with relevant standardisation bodies, in areas such as:        
 Hardware-software interfaces in quantum computing,    
 Quantum sensing protocols and metrology methods,    
 Control electronics and device modularity for quantum systems,    
 Performance and benchmarking methodologies.   
• Supporting the participation of quantum stakeholders in European and international 
standardisation organisations (e.g. CEN-CENELEC, ETSI, ISO/IEC, ITU-T) 
• Coordination with existing European and international standardisation organisations to 
ensure alignment and avoid duplication. 
• Development of support materials such as user guides, training modules, and best 
practices for the standards developed. 
• Organisation of workshops and consultations with quantum stakeholders (including 
SMEs, start-ups, and large industry) to ensure inclusivity and consensus building.  
The proposal must present a clear plan for stakeholder engagement, deliverables, and budget 
justification, including person -days per task and daily rates. A single proposal is expected. 
European standardisation organisations (ESOs) are encouraged to lead or be key partners in 
the consortium.
