Call: DIGITAL 
Specific conditions 
Expected EU 
contribution per 
project 
The Commission estimates that an EU contribution of around EUR 10.00 
million would allow these outcomes to be addressed appropriately. 
Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of a proposal 
requesting different amounts. 
Indicative 
budget 
The total indicative budget for the topic is EUR 10.00 million. 
Type of Action Research and Innovation Actions 
Eligibility 
conditions 
The conditions are described in General Annex B. The following 
exceptions apply: 
In order to achieve the expected outcomes, and safeguard the Union’s 
strategic assets, interests, autonomy, and security, it is important to avoid 
a situation of technological dependency on a non -EU source, in a global 
context that requires the EU to take action to build on its strengths, and to 
carefully assess and address any strategic weaknesses, vulnerabilities and 
high-risk dependencies which put at risk the attainment of its ambitions. 
For this reason, participation is limited to legal entities establ ished in 
Member States, Iceland and Norway and the following additional 
associated countries: Canada, Israel, Republic of Korea, New Zealand, 
Switzerland, and the United Kingdom. In addition, entities established in 
third countries which may become associated to Horizon Europe during 
2026 and 2027 may be eligible to participate in this topic if the third 
country is identified for this topic as an eligible country in the List of 
Participating Countries in Horizon Europe at the time of submission of the 
application130. In any case, the association agreement to the Programme 
must apply by the time of the signature of the grant agreement. 
For the duly justified and exceptional reasons listed in the paragraph 
above, in order to guarantee the protection of the strategic interests of the 
 
Union and its Member States, entities established in an eligible country 
listed above, but which are directly or indirectly controlled by a non -
eligible country or by a non -eligible country entity, may not participate in 
the action unless it can be demonstrated, by means of guarantees 
positively assessed by their eligible country of establishment, that their 
participation to the action would not negatively impact the Union’s 
strategic assets, interests, autonomy, or security. Entities assessed as high -
risk suppliers of mobile network communication equipment within the 
meaning of ‘restrictions for the protection of European communication 
networks’ (or entities fully or partially owned or controlled by a high -risk 
supplier) cannot submit guarantees.131 
Technology 
Readiness Level 
Activities are expected to start at TRL 4 and achieve TRL 7 by the end of 
the project – see General Annex B. 
 
Expected Outcome : This action will establish a strategic European initiative to develop 
scalable, modular, and interoperable photonic quantum computing platforms. Proposals for 
this topic are expected to address and provide credible solutions to at least two major 
technical roadblocks  currently limiting the advancement of photonic quantum computing 
such as: 
• The lack of deterministic, high -efficiency photonic entanglement and loss -tolerant 
architectures suitable for fault-tolerant scaling 
• The absence of a standardised, integrated control stack combining photonic hardware, 
firmware, and system software with reliable benchmarking across platforms  
Project results are expected to contribute to the following expected outcomes: 
• By 2028, demonstration of a photonic NISQ processor with ≥100 photonic qubits, 
integrating deterministic single-photon sources, low-loss waveguides, on-chip detectors, 
and a firmware stack (scheduler, controller, compiler), validated via hardware -agnostic 
benchmarks and hybrid photonic -HPC applications demonstrating classical -quantum 
crossover 
 
• By 2030, delivery of a full -stack, high -connectivity photonic quantum computer, with 
modular scalability, integrated on -chip and fibre -based interconnects, and high -fidelity 
gates (e.g. error rates ≤10⁻³) with an indicative target of 1 000 photonic qubits, laying the 
groundwork for prototype demonstrations of quantum utility on industrially relevant 
workloads. 
• System-level interoperability and standardisation, with published interface specifications 
across photonic quantum hardware and software stacks including packaging, APIs, 
compiler interfaces, and cloud protocols compatible with telecom wavelengths 
• Validation of entanglement distribution across modules through standardised protocols 
and field-demonstration of interconnected photonic quantum processors 
• Acceleration of industrialisation and commercialisation, including a roadmap for pilot 
manufacturing lines, quality assurance protocols, and development of a sovereign 
European supply chain for photonic quantum technologies 
• Demonstration of project results through a concrete use case provided by a major end-
user partner within the consortium, validating the platform’s relevance and performance 
under real operational constraints.  
Scope: Proposals for this topic are expected to be led by a startup  with demonstrated 
expertise in photonic quantum computing. The startup should collaborate with relevant 
academic, industrial, and RTO partners to ensure both technological depth and market 
orientation. The consortium should also include at least one major end -user whose 
operational needs will shape the platform design, and whose infrastructure will host the field 
demonstration of the project’s results. 
Proposals should implement a coordinated, durable R&I programme that integrates hardware, 
software, system architecture, and application-level use cases. Activities should include: 
• Platform development advancing open, scalable photonic quantum processors with 
semiconductor and/or glass -based photonic chips, integrated control electronics, 
firmware, and robust error mitigation and correction schemes 
• System integration realising modular quantum nodes with photonic interconnects and 
validating scalable architectures under realistic noise, loss, and control constraints 
• Software stack co -design integrating low -level firmware, compilers, hybrid algorithms, 
and network APIs to demonstrate application -level quantum advantage and HPC 
interoperability  
Proposals are expected to build upon prior Quantum Flagship results and demonstrate 
capacity to contribute actively to the governance and strategic coordination of the EU 
quantum computing ecosystem, including synergies with STEP, Chips JU, IPCEI projects and 
EuroHPC.
