Type of Action Research and Innovation Actions 
Eligibility 
conditions 
The conditions are described in General Annex B. The following 
exceptions apply: 
If projects use satellite -based earth observation, positioning, navigation 
and/or related timing data and services, beneficiaries must make use of 
Copernicus and/or Galileo/EGNOS (other data and services may 
additionally be used). 
In order to achieve the expected outcomes, and safeguard the Union’s 
strategic assets, interests, autonomy, or security, participation is limited to 
legal entities established in Member States, Norway and Iceland. 
Proposals including entities established in countries outside the scope 
specified in the call/topic/action will be ineligible. 
For the duly justified and exceptional reasons listed in the paragraph 
above, in order to guarantee the protection of the strategic interests of the 
Union and its Member States, entities established in an eligible country 
listed above, but which are directly or indirectly controlled by a non -
eligible country or by a non -eligible country entity, may not participate in 
the action unless it can be demonstrated, by means of guarantees 
positively assessed by their eligible country of establishment, that their 
participation to the action would not negatively impact the Union’s 
strategic assets, interests, autonomy, or security. Entities assessed as high -
risk suppliers of mobile network communication equipment within the 
meaning of ‘restrictions for the protection of European communication 
networks’ (or entities fully or partially owned or controlled by a high -risk 
supplier) cannot submit guarantees.173 
Technology 
Readiness Level 
Activities are expected to achieve TRL 4 -6 by the end of the project. The 
reference TRL definition is the ISO 16290:2013 applicable to the space 
sector. 
Procedure The procedure is described in General Annex F. The following exceptions 
 
apply: 
Eligible proposals submitted under this topic and exceeding all the 
evaluation thresholds will be awarded a STEP Seal 174. 
To ensure a balanced portfolio covering all the development areas 
described in the scope section, grants will be awarded to applications not 
only in order of ranking but at least also to one proposal that is the highest 
ranked within each development area, provided that the applications attain 
all thresholds. 
 
Expected Outcome: Projects are expected to contribute to the following outcomes: 
• Support the EU space policy by fostering the development of groundbreaking space 
technology and support the Quantum Europe Strategy. 
• Enhance the technological maturation of the critical components necessary to perform 
quantum space gravimetry. 
• Foster the technological leadership and non -dependence of the EU in the field of 
quantum gravimetry from space and promote the EU’s competitiveness in quantum 
technologies.  
This action aims at supporting the maturation, development and/or implementation of 
quantum gravimetry technology for space.  
Monitoring the Earth gravity field provides key information and data on Earth mass 
movements. This type of data is of utmost importance for Earth science and used in many 
areas, for example to monitor ice sheet changes, floods or droughts, volcanic activities and 
earthquakes. The community of users for such data spans from climate scientists to 
geophysicists and relies on quality and precise data. Monitoring the Earth gravity field from 
space provides a global scale to the user community and fosters the development of models 
and understanding of the Earth as an integrated and global system.  
Space gravimetry data provided up to now (or planned in the near future) is using an 
underlying technology based on electrostatic accelerometers, which has reached its limits in 
terms of performance. Accelerometers based on quantum technology may offer enhanced 
performances in terms of sensitivity, accuracy, stability and operational time compared to 
these classical accelerometers.  
The European Commission is committed to the development of quantum technologies and for 
this purpose, adopted the Quantum Europe Strategy in July 2025 ( Quantum Europe Strategy | 
Shaping Europe’s digital future ). This strategy identifies Space as a critical element and 
highlights the benefits of quantum sensing, including for fundamental science. The strategy 
provides the case for a network of mobile and stationary quantum sensors and foresees the 
deployment of ground, airborne and space -based gravimeters for Earth observation purposes. 
 
The strategy highlights the need for and importance of developing a space compatible 
technology to fulfil this ambition.  
Quantum technologies are also identified as a critical R&I area in the EU Economic Security 
Strategy ( eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:52023JC0020). 
Mastering this technology will contribute to the EU technological sovereignty and foster the 
development of an EU non -dependent quantum & space ecosystem, able to address the EU’s 
ambitions for its space policy. 
To meet these strategic objectives and envisage a full -blown quantum space gravimetry 
capacity, the development and in -orbit testing of a quantum accelerometer is a pre -requisite. 
The European Commission has been supporting the development of quantum accelerometer 
technology for ground and space gravimetry with dedicated calls in Horizon Europe.  
This call will support the implementation, development and maturation of quantum 
accelerometer technologies for space gravimetry. Proposals should present a technological 
solution provided it is quantum -based, aims at enhancing the performance of gravimetry 
mission(s) currently planned (based on electrostatic accelerometers), and the resulting projects 
are expected to be consistent with a common overarching roadmap and recommendations to 
be established in close coordination with EU Member States, Norway and Iceland through a 
dedicated Quantum Space Gravimetry Expert Group (QSGEG). The action should foster the 
development of the underlying technology and result in a breadboard / payload prototype 
subsystems / engineering models demonstrating the feasibility and expected performance of 
the technological solution and its potential further development for integration on a satellite 
platform, the design of which should also be presented. Proposals should also provide a clear 
implementation strategy allowing the chosen solution to be tested in-orbit in a demonstrator in 
the future, the associated development lifecycle of which is free of choice (ECSS or other).  
Scope: The areas of R&I, which needs to be addressed to tackle the above -mentioned 
expected outcomes are: 
• Area 1: R&I on the technology based on cold atom interferometry with Bose Einstein 
Condensates (BECs) for Quantum Space Gravimetry. Proposals should aim at the 
maturation of all relevant technology to TRL 6 and deliver engineering and qualification 
models of the payload subsystems to demonstrate the technology in orbit. 
• Area 2: R&I on emerging technology for Quantum Space Gravimetry such as SQUIDs 
(Superconducting Quantum Interference Devices) or nuclear spin -based gravimeters or 
hybridized technology (list not exhaustive). Proposals should aim at the development of 
the relevant technology to TRL 4 -5 and deliver breadboards or prototypes of a payload 
aiming at demonstrating the technology in orbit.  
Proposals should contribute to one of the above R&I areas and this area should be clearly and 
unambiguously identified. To ensure a balanced portfolio covering the two areas described 
above, grants will be awarded to applications not only in order of ranking but at least also to 
one proposal that is the highest ranked within each area, provided that the applications attain 
all thresholds. Intellectual Property (IP) rights and ownership must be clearly defined and the 
provisions in Article 16 of the Horizon Europe Model Grant Agreement shall apply (relevant 
to protection, exploitation, transfer and licensing, access rights to results and background). 
The beneficiaries of the grant should also reflect on the availability of the IPs for potential 
next steps of the activity. 
Where applicable, proposers are invited to explore synergies with or build -upon past actions 
related to quantum technology and/or space gravimetry either at national or EU level. 
In this topic, the integration of the gender dimension (sex and gender analysis) in research and 
innovation content should be addressed only if relevant in relation to the objectives of the 
research effort.
