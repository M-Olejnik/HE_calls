Call: DIGITAL 
Specific conditions 
Expected EU 
contribution per 
project 
The Commission estimates that an EU contribution of around EUR 18.00 
million would allow these outcomes to be addressed appropriately. 
Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of a proposal 
requesting different amounts. 
Indicative 
budget 
The total indicative budget for the topic is EUR 18.00 million. 
Type of Action Innovation Actions 
Eligibility 
conditions 
The conditions are described in General Annex B. The following 
exceptions apply: 
In order to achieve the expected outcomes, and safeguard the Union’s 
strategic assets, interests, autonomy, and security, it is important to avoid 
a situation of technological dependency on a non -EU source, in a global 
context that requires the EU to take action to build on its strengths, and to 
carefully assess and address any strategic weaknesses, vulnerabilities and 
high-risk dependencies which put at risk the attainment of its ambitions. 
For this reason, participation is limited to legal entities establ ished in 
Member States, Iceland and Norway and the following additional 
associated countries: Canada, Israel, Republic of Korea, New Zealand, 
Switzerland, and the United Kingdom. In addition, entities established in 
third countries which may become associated to Horizon Europe during 
2026 and 2027 may be eligible to participate in this topic if the third 
country is identified for this topic as an eligible country in the List of 
Participating Countries in Horizon Europe at the time of submission of the 
application113. In any case, the association agreement to the Programme 
must apply by the time of the signature of the grant agreement. 
For the duly justified and exceptional reasons listed in the paragraph 
above, in order to guarantee the protection of the strategic interests of the 
Union and its Member States, entities established in an eligible country 
 
listed above, but which are directly or indirectly controlled by a non -
eligible country or by a non -eligible country entity, may not participate in 
the action unless it can be demonstrated, by means of guarantees 
positively assessed by their eligible country of establishment, that their 
participation to the action would not negatively impact the Union’s 
strategic assets, interests, autonomy, or security. Entities assessed as high -
risk suppliers of mobile network communication equipment within the 
meaning of  ‘restrictions for the protection of European communication 
networks’ (or entities fully or partially owned or controlled by a high -risk 
supplier) cannot submit guarantees.114 
Technology 
Readiness Level 
Activities are expected to start at TRL 4 and achieve TRL 7 by the end of 
the project – see General Annex B. 
 
Expected Outcome : The Apply AI Strategy emphasises acceleration pipelines to ensure a 
smooth transition from research to deployment of AI -powered robotics. Projects under this 
topic will deliver common frameworks and reusable building blocks that can serve multiple 
sectors and use cases, reinforcing Europe’s ability to bring AI-driven robotics to scale. 
Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected outcomes: 
• Wider and faster deployment of robotics, bridging the gap between technology providers 
and end-users. 
• Development and implementation of modular and interoperable integration frameworks 
and solutions, including standardized protocols for data, training and safety testing, 
evaluation and validation of robotic solutions in key use cases 
• Improved competitiveness of European industries, notably SMEs via the development of 
advanced robotics systems, intelligent planning and control systems, user feedback 
rendering techniques and cutting-edge AI innovations  
Scope: The project will address the current European gap in system integration capabilities for 
robotics solutions addressing the various needs of industries. The project will aim at 
disseminating a deep understanding of state -of-the-art robotics components, including both 
 
hardware and software, and expertise in addressing interoperability issues for the upskilling of 
system integrators. 
To maximise the impact and adaptability of deployed systems, the approach should consider 
the most appropriate tools to speed up integration processes and suitable AI design, training 
and inference methodologies, ensuring scalability, transferability, transparency, robustness, 
flexibility, and real-world applicability in diverse industrial environments, and should remain 
adaptable to the latest technological developments. 
Integration frameworks will promote the use of energy -efficient AI models and hardware 
('Green AI'), alongside carbon -aware deployment and operational strategies for robotic 
system. Where relevant, projects should contribute to open and widely recognised standards 
to foster interoperability and uptake across the robotics ecosystem. To enhance safety and 
performance, projects may include high -fidelity simulation environments or digital twins as 
testbeds for training, validation and verification, with measures to ensure smooth transfer 
from simulation to real-world deployment. 
By bridging the gap between technology providers and end-users, these integrators will enable 
the creation of seamless, reliable and scalable robotics systems that can be easily adopted by 
industries, especially SMEs, thereby supporting more flexible and efficient production 
processes. 
The project is expected to deliver: 
• A deployable, modular integration framework, validated through at least three real-world 
industrial pilots covering different reference scenarios to demonstrate that the approach 
can be adapted to varied industrial needs and company sizes, including both SMEs and 
larger manufacturers. This framework should provide, for example, a common software 
layer, standard interfaces to connect to existing workflow and legacy system, possibly 
also to connect various robot components, coordinate multiple robots and link them with 
additional AI tools and IoT environments, as well as tested configuration templates and 
clear guidelines to ensure safe and efficient use. 
• An Integration Kit, building on this framework, which offers ready -to-use modules, 
example configurations and practical tools that help system integrators and companies to 
set up, test and run AI -enabled robotics solutions more quickly and with reduced 
technical effort. 
• Where relevant, high -fidelity digital twin testbeds should be linked to each pilot, 
allowing safe and realistic testing and training before deployment, and supporting a 
smooth transition from virtual models to actual production lines. 
• Reusable, datasets (compliant with relevant regulation and IP protection) and practical 
benchmark tasks, made available to the wider robotics and AI community, to support 
further development and comparison of new solutions while respecting European data 
protection rules. 
• A clear Step -by-Step Adoption Guide aimed at SMEs and other end -users, providing 
easy-to-follow instructions, practical checklists and examples to help companies plan, 
budget and implement AI -driven robotics in a safe and cost -effective way, even if they 
have limited in -house expertise, and including guidance to navigate regulatory 
compliance and certification. 
• Concrete contributions to relevant open standards and clear guidance on certification 
pathways, to help ensure compliance with European regulations and build trust in the 
safe use of AI in robotics. Projects are expected to make full use of existing robotics 
resources and assets made available through the AI -on-Demand Platform, such as the 
EuroCORE repository and other relevant shared tools, to maximise synergies, avoid 
duplication of efforts and ensure broad dissemination and reuse of results within the 
European AI and robotics community.  
This topic implements the co -programmed European Partnership on AI, data, and robotics 
(ADRA), and all proposals are expected to allocate tasks for cohesion activities with ADRA.
