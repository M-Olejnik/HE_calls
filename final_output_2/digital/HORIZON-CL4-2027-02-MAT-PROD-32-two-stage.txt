Community (2021-2025) 48. 
 
Expected Outcome:  
• A significant decarbonisation of processes (measured by the reduction of GHG 
emissions from the overall system) with broad applicability and economic viability. 
• Facilitation of the transition from fossil-based energy inputs for:        
 low/medium thermal energy demands by introducing renewable -based alternatives 
and heat upgrading.     
 High-temperature processes, by innovative technologies for electrified and hybrid 
high-temperature processes, high temperature energy storage.   
• Clean energy usage is given a boost through innovative advanced materials, system 
concepts and technologies for energy integration and energy storage, supporting 
resilience against energy supply variations 
• Combination of significant energy savings and integrated management of energy 
systems and production processes  
 
Scope: Most processes in the process industries require significant energy inputs which 
currently lead to substantial CO2 emissions by the process industries. The reduction of the 
CO2 footprint can be achieved by several measures, e.g. electrification or use of other 
renewable sources of energy, lowering of the energy demand, increasing energy efficiency, 
and energy integration. This topic aims to lead to significant steps in reducing the CO2 
footprint by technological innovations, at least by 20%. 
A key problem in the use of renewable energy sources is their fluctuation over time. Projects 
should take this into account and develop solutions that aim for energy efficiency and include 
novel storage technologies of relevance to the process industries. Pure demand -side 
management by production schedules adapted to the supply of electricity from renewable 
sources is not within the scope of the call. 
In situations where full electrification is not feasible or competitive in the foreseeable future, 
sustainable hybrid solutions play a crucial role. These solutions enhance flexibility, allowing 
industries to manage the variability in the availability of affordable renewable electricity, 
which is expected to fluctuate significantly in the medium term. E.g., preheating processes 
can utilize fossil-free energy sources such as solar heat, geothermal heat, heat pumps, resistive 
or induction heating, and electric boilers. This initial stage can be followed by further heating 
using fossil -based methods initially, and later transitioning to renewable -based combustion 
processes to achieve the required process temperatures. 
To enhance resilience, the capture, storage, and management of energy flows should be 
tailored to the needs of the process industry. This may include research and innovation in safe 
and sustainable innovative advanced materials for (latent or sensible) energy storage, e.g. 
phase change materials and heat storage via chemical energy carriers beyond E-fuels. 
Proposals under this topic should address several of the following: 
• Advancements in the use of energy from renewable sources in production processes with 
improved energy efficiency. 
• Integrated energy systems with novel storage elements to enable a smooth operation of 
the plants despite variations in the availability of energy from renewable sources. 
• Solutions for low/medium temperature (100 - 500 °C) energy inputs in energy intensive 
industries including hybrid solutions and a progressive reduction of the use of fossil 
carriers of energy. 
• Solutions for high temperature (> 500 °C) energy inputs in energy intensive industries, 
including high temperature electricity driven processes, and high temperature energy 
storage. 
• Application of high -performance insulation materials and new innovative advanced 
materials that can improve heat capture, storage, and retrieval, particularly for scalable 
high-temperature applications. Such materials should minimize the use of critical raw 
material, enabling effective recycling.  
Projects should include demonstrations at pilot scale, preferably in real industrial 
environments, to validate the proposed technologies and processes under real -world industrial 
conditions 
Proposals related to innovative advanced materials development should address the most 
relevant gaps to focus on in the frame from materials design to technology deployment and 
ensure adequate feedback loops between different steps to drive forward innovative solutions 
which can be easily deployed. Scalability and requirements from application/industry need to 
be considered early on in the innovation process. 
The inclusion of a GHG avoidance methodology 49 is recommended  and should provide 
detailed descriptions of baselines and projected emissions reduction. 
Proposals should include a business case and exploitation strategy, as outlined in the 
introduction to this Destination, underlining how the proposal will serve the purpose to boost 
industrial decarbonisation technologies supply chain in Europe. As project output an 
elaborated exploitation plan should be developed, including preliminary plans for scalability, 
commercialisation and deployment (feasibility study, business plan and financial model) 
indicating possible private and public funding sources (e.g. Innovation Fund, InvestEU and 
cohesion policy funds). Societal - and environmental impact as well as implications for the 
workplace (including skills and organisational change) should be outlined.
