HORIZON-CL4-2027-01-MAT-PROD-49: ‘Proof of market’ to improve valorisation 
and commercialisation of Horizon generated R&I results (IA) 
Call: INDUSTRY 
Specific conditions 
Expected EU 
contribution per 
project 
The Commission estimates that an EU contribution of around EUR 0.20 
million would allow these outcomes to be addressed appropriately. 
Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of a 
proposal requesting different amounts. 
Indicative budget The total indicative budget for the topic is EUR 5.00 million. 
Type of Action Innovation Actions 
Eligibility 
conditions 
The conditions are described in General Annex B. The following 
exceptions apply: 
In line with the “ restriction on control in innovation actions in critical 
technology areas ” delineated in General Annex B of the General 
Annexes, entities established in an eligible country but which are 
directly or indirectly controlled by China or by a legal entity established 
in China are not eligible to participate in the action. 
Legal and financial 
set-up of the Grant 
Agreements 
The rules are described in General Annex G. The following exceptions 
apply: 
The granting authority may, up to 4 years after the end of the action, 
object to a transfer of ownership or to the exclusive licensing of results, 
as set out in the specific provision of Annex 5. 
 
Expected Outcome:  
• The commercial potential of Horizon research results is explored; 
• Results of Horizon projects are valorised, by ensuring a pathway to commercialisation; 
and 
• Startups and SMEs become involved in valorisation.  
Scope: The EU must do better in translating the knowledge generated by the Framework 
Programme into innovations with economic and societal value. 
The objective of this action is to provide financial support (‘Proof of market’) to small 
consortia (i.e. spin -offs, startups, SMEs) to explore the exploitation potential, in the EU, of 
achieved results from ongoing or completed projects funded under Cluster 4 ‘Digital, Industry 
and Space’ or its predecessor activities under the Leadership in enabling and industrial 
technologies (LEIT)58 part of Horizon 2020. 
The consortia do not necessarily have to be made of former or current beneficiaries but should 
own or have access to the knowledge assets of projects, including intellectual property, where 
relevant. 
Proposals should envisage valorisation activities, such as: 
• demonstrating a technology (e.g. testing); 
• defining a commercialisation process; 
• undertaking:        
 a market and competitiveness analysis;    
 a technology assessment and/or certification;    
 a verification of innovation potential;   
• assessing potential “end users” of the expected innovation; 
• testing, piloting with users or potential customers; 
• complying with regulatory compliance and standards; 
• consolidating IP rights.  
Proposals should address achieved results from ongoing or completed Research and 
Innovation Actions and Innovation Actions (RIA/IA) funded directly under Cluster 4 ‘Digital, 
Industry and Space’ or its predecessor activities under the Leadership in enabling and 
industrial technologies (LEIT) part of Horizon 2020. 
Applicants can be owners of the achieved results from previous projects or new participants. 
Proposals should include at least one of the following: 
• Confirmation that at least one of the applicants of the current proposal is the owner or 
holder of the relevant knowledge assets including Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) and 
possesses the necessary rights to commercialise the results for the entire duration of the 
proposed project, or 
 
• Commitment letter from the owner(s) of the relevant result(s) confirming the owner(s)’ 
willingness to negotiate fair, reasonable, and non -discriminatory access to the results, 
including IPR where relevant, for the purpose of future commercial exploitation.  
The proposal should specify the grant number and acronym of the project(s) which generated 
the results. 
Proposals should present a clear vision of the intended pathway to market. Hence, the 
participation of a business partner should be envisaged.
