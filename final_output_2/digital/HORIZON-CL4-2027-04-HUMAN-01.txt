HORIZON-CL4-2027-04-HUMAN-01: Advanced and Innovative hardware components 
for Virtual Worlds (RIA) (Virtual Worlds Partnership) 
Call: DIGITAL 
Specific conditions 
Expected EU 
contribution per 
project 
The Commission estimates that an EU contribution of between EUR 
4.80 and 5.60 million would allow these outcomes to be addressed 
appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and 
selection of a proposal requesting different amounts. 
Indicative budget The total indicative budget for the topic is EUR 39.00 million. 
Type of Action Research and Innovation Actions 
Eligibility conditions The conditions are described in General Annex B. The following 
exceptions apply: 
Subject to restrictions for the protection of European communication 
networks. 
Technology 
Readiness Level 
Activities are expected to start at TRL 3 and achieve TRL 5 by the 
end of the project – see General Annex B. 
Legal and financial 
set-up of the Grant 
Agreements 
The rules are described in General Annex G. The following 
exceptions apply: 
The granting authority may, up to 4 years after the end of the action, 
object to a transfer of ownership or to the exclusive licensing of 
results, as set out in the specific provision of Annex 5. 
 
Expected Outcome: Projects are expected to contribute to the following outcomes: 
• Innovative and advanced XR hardware, advanced headsets, screens, wearables and 
haptic components, sensors and actuators, advanced chips for a deeper and closer -to-
reality immersion, stimulating all human senses.  
Scope: In the recent years, hardware for Virtual Worlds made major breakthroughs, 
democratising headsets, sensors, actuators or haptic equipment. To keep this momentum and 
advancing further, new generation of XR equipment, wearable solutions and haptic 
components, as well as non -invasive brain computer interfaces for handsfree interaction, 
hardware or technologies will put the users at the very centre of virtual experiences, for even 
greater and realistic immersion, aiming at blurring the lines between the real and digital 
environments. To ensure this next generation of engaging and lifelike immersion, all senses 
must be stimulated (sight, hearing, feel, touch, smell), for a fully immersive close -to-reality 
experience. Users will be submerged with realistic sensations making the experience as 
immersive as possible. 
Proposals should investigate novel scientific approaches or push the limit of existing ones to 
improve the synchronization and integration of the different modalities. 
Proposals will integrate various components in fully tested devices, demonstrating the 
usefulness and efficiency of their system in illustrative scenarios in the industrial and societal 
contexts. 
Proposals should focus on performant, reliable, miniaturised, interoperable advanced and 
innovative technologies, with inclusivity, energy consumption and energy efficiency at the 
centre of concerns. 
This topic requires the effective contribution of SSH disciplines and the involvement of SSH 
experts, institutions as well as the inclusion of relevant SSH expertise, in order to produce 
meaningful and significant effects enhancing the societal impact of the related research 
activities. 
The Consortium should pay attention to developing solutions that are reliable, robust and 
interoperable. Proposals should leverage existing open standards and technologies in the 
domain of Virtual Worlds, while contributing to ongoing standardisation work. 
Beneficiaries that intend to transfer ownership or grant an exclusive licence must formally 
notify the granting authority (i.e. DG -CNECT and HaDEA) before the intended transfer or 
licensing takes place and the granting authority may up to four years after the end of the 
action object to a transfer of ownership or the exclusive licensing of results. 
We consider that proposals with an overall duration of typically 36 months would allow these 
outcomes to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and 
selection of proposals requesting other durations. 
This topic implements the co-programmed European Partnership on Virtual Worlds.
