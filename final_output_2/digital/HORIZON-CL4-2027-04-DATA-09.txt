processing in Data Centres (IA) 
Call: DIGITAL 
Specific conditions 
Expected EU 
contribution per 
project 
The Commission estimates that an EU contribution of around EUR 10.00 
million would allow these outcomes to be addressed appropriately. 
Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of a proposal 
requesting different amounts. 
Indicative 
budget 
The total indicative budget for the topic is EUR 39.00 million. 
Type of Action Innovation Actions 
Eligibility 
conditions 
The conditions are described in General Annex B. The following 
exceptions apply: 
In line with the “ restriction on control in innovation actions in critical 
technology areas” delineated in General Annex B of the General Annexes, 
entities established in an eligible country but which are directly or 
indirectly controlled by China or by a legal entity established in China are 
not eligible to participate in the action. 
Subject to restrictions for the protection of European communication 
networks. 
Technology 
Readiness Level 
Activities are expected to start at TRL 6 -7 and achieve TRL 8 by the end 
of the project – see General Annex B. 
Procedure The procedure is described in General Annex F. The following exceptions 
apply: 
To ensure a balanced portfolio coverage, grants will be awarded to 
applications not only in order of ranking, but also to at least three 
proposals addressing expected outcomes 1 -3 (improve heat removal from 
high-power AI, novel backup power systems and data centre optimisation 
for energy-efficient AI processing) and one proposal focussed on offering 
an open pilot demonstration site, subject to proposals passing all 
evaluation thresholds. 
 
Expected Outcome: Pilots for new technologies and a demonstration site which contribute to 
energy-efficient and sustainable AI data processing in data centres, reinforcing EU strategic 
autonomy and climate goals. Project results are expected to contribute to one or more of the 
following outcomes (see more details in scope): 
• Demonstrated innovations that substantially improve heat removal from high -power AI 
chips (e.g. direct on -chip cooling, advanced thermal interface materials, multi -scale 
thermal management), enabling higher performance without thermal throttling. This 
should lead to lower cooling energy needs and higher reliability for dense AI workloads. 
• Prototypes of novel backup power systems (such as graphene -enhanced batteries) that 
operate with minimal cooling requirements, improving data centre resilience and 
enabling better use of renewable power. 
• New methods and frameworks that optimise the entire data centre for energy-efficient AI 
processing. This includes intelligent workload scheduling and AI model optimisation 
techniques to reduce energy use (e.g. carbon-aware job scheduling and power capping to 
cut energy demand and peak temperatures), as well as designs for integrating on -site/off-
site renewables and waste-heat reuse. 
• As a result of all the above bullet points, an open pilot demonstration site that allows for 
the testing and integration of the outcomes of these projects and serves as the European 
reference for showcasing the breakthroughs and cutting -edge technologies for energy -
efficient and sustainable data centres developed under this topic. This site should serve 
as a model for technology uptake for the European data centre industry.  
Outcomes should demonstrate potential for improved power usage effectiveness and 
utilisation of waste heat in external applications, aligned with European targets for carbon -
neutral heating/cooling. 
Scope: Actions should address the following development areas:   
1. Direct on-chip cooling and thermal management, including novel and innovative cooling 
techniques applied at chip and module level (direct liquid cooling, heat spreaders, 
thermal interface materials, and advanced packaging) and multi -scale thermal 
management techniques. 
2. Energy-efficient power backup and storage systems: Innovations in early -stage energy 
storage concepts (graphene -enhanced batteries, supercapacitors, and other emerging 
battery chemistries) and approaches for net-zero backup. 
3. Sustainable data centre architectures and AI workload optimization: addressing AI -
driven workload scheduling, adaptive power management, dynamic resource allocation 
and integration of data centre heat capture and reuse. 
4. Materials research for energy efficiency: Projects to make use of existing research in 
new materials and components supporting energy efficiency and thermal management, 
and to employ these for data centres benefit. 
5. Optimisation of data centre operation and functioning: explore AI solutions to optimize 
the Data centre functioning, computing architecture, and virtualization, minimizing its 
carbon and environmental footprint. 
6. Integration of data centres into energy systems and the wider region: including solutions 
that integrate Data centres into energy system planning and operation.  
Aside from these, the pilot demonstration site must allow to combine the outcomes supplied 
by the other funded projects in the topic and enable for showcasing, benchmarking, and 
promoting their results across interested industrial stakeholders, including the European data 
centre and collocation industry, as well as other AI data centre operators, such as cloud and 
edge computing providers. 
Overall, this topic is expected to fund four projects. Three projects are expected to address 
expected outcomes 1 -3, while a fourth project is expected for expected outcome 4 (the open 
pilot demonstration site). For projects addressing expected outcomes 1 -3 at least two use 
cases should showcase each project results.  
Beneficiaries that intend to transfer ownership or grant an exclusive licence must formally 
notify the granting authority (i.e. DG -CNECT and HaDEA) before the intended transfer or 
licensing takes place and the granting authority may up to four years after the end of the 
action object to a transfer of ownership or the exclusive licensing of results. 
Projects funded under this topic are encouraged to build synergies and leverage their 
outcomes with funded projects from Cluster 5 HORIZON -CL5-2027-05-D4-06: Thermal 
energy optimisation and waste heat recovery of high energy demand IT rooms in buildings or 
small edge data centres.
