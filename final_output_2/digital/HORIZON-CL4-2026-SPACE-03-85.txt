Expected Outcome: Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected 
outcomes: 
• Reinforcing EU strategic autonomy by reducing non -EU dependencies on critical space 
EEE components across their entire supply chain, including radiation testing facilities; 
• Providing unrestricted access to critical space EEE components and testing facilities 
relevant for EU space missions (Galileo, EGNOS, Copernicus, IRIS 2 and EU pilot 
missions on In-Orbit Space Operations and Quantum Gravimetry); 
• Developing or regaining capacity to operate independently in space by developing 
resilient space EEE components and testing facilities supply chains, relying on EU 
supply chains and/or trustable and reliable supply chains not affected by non -EU export 
restrictions; 
 
• Enhancing competitiveness by developing products and capabilities reaching equivalent 
or superior performance level than those from outside the EU and compete at worldwide 
level.  
Scope: Unrestricted access to state-of-art space EEE components and related technologies is a 
pre-requisite for the EU space industry responding to EU space missions. However, especially 
for some families of components, the available solutions in EU do not meet the current high -
performance space requirements. This is also the case for testing facilities, especially high and 
very high energy testing facilities which are not available in EU. Currently, alternative 
irradiation testing facilities located outside EU, are either overbooked or often prioritized 
under the light on national security limiting their use by EU space stakeholder or severely 
delaying their access. This represents a challenge in terms of reliable and trustable supply 
chains for the implementation of EU space missions. 
Within the frame of this topic, it is expected to finance and implement a development project 
aiming at maturing the development of a dedicated irradiation test facility open to EU space 
stakeholders with focus on testing EEE components for space applications and final goal of 
lowering the dependency from outside EU. This will be done by moving from small scale 
prototype irradiation testing demonstrations to a fully -fledged irradiation test facility with 
sufficient beam time spread across the entire year supporting EU strategic autonomy in the 
space sector. The selection of the supply chains shall reflect this objective. Therefore, the 
supply chain shall preferably be built fully based in EU and when this can only be achieved 
partially, services procured from outside EU shall nevertheless ensure that the overall supply 
chain will remain trustable, not subject to national prioritization and not affected by non -EU 
export control. The latest scenario is subject to the approval of the granting authority (i.e. DG-
DEFIS and HaDEA). 
The focused space development relevant for this topic has been identified based on needs 
related to strategic institutional space programs, inputs from European stakeholders and the 
EU Observatory of Critical Technologies: High and Very High Energy (70 MeV/n up to 
1GeV/n) Irradiation Test Facility Deployment . Further details will be provided at the latest 
at the opening of the Call, in a Guidance document published on the Funding & Tenders 
Portal. 
Space is a low volume market affected by a dynamic industrial landscape compared to the 
terrestrial market therefore, technological spin in and/or bilateral collaborations should be 
enhanced between European non-space and space industries. Furthermore, proposed activities 
should be complementary to relevant national or other activities at European level. 
Complementary activities should be clearly identified, described and the proposal should 
report how the complementarity is ensured. 
To achieve the non -dependence objective, applicants are expected to include a dedicated 
proposal’s paragraph covering: 
• The description of the technology that will be used for providing the irradiation beam 
and high -level breakdown of the supply chain relevant for the whole test facility. 
Applicants should demonstrate that the supply chain and final test facility are free of any 
legal export restrictions or limitations, such as those established in the International 
Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) or equivalent instruments applicable in other non -
EU jurisdictions. Applicants shall also report, in a dedicated subsection, if and which 
part of the supply chain is affected by non -EU export controls such as the Export 
Administration regulation (EAR) i.e. EAR99.  
The testing facility shall be open and accessible toward EU and non -EU space stakeholders 
nevertheless in case the amount of beam time requested will be exceeding the beam time 
available, the allocation shall be prioritizing EU based stakeholders. Requests coming from 
non-EU shall be analysed on an ad -hoc basis, considering also the remaining available beam 
time. This prioritization scheme shall be reflected in the proposal. The test facility as well as 
related control software and booking platform/website toward the public should clearly report 
the EU flag. 
The proposal is expected to include specific tasks as part of the work plan and related 
dedicated confidential deliverables to be provided within six months from the start of the 
project, with the objective of:   
1. Analysing and describing, in detail, the full supply chain, each entity and its role in the 
supply chain, level of criticality and, if relevant, identify dependencies from outside EU; 
2. Describing the technical roadmap and a business plan for commercialization (e.g. open 
access of the facility to the external space stakeholders) and future possible upgrades 
with accurate understanding of applications needs and relevance for EU space missions. 
3. Undertaking a comprehensive literature review of the relevant high and very high energy 
radiation test facilities at global level reporting the state -of-the-art and highlighting 
potential gaps between current EU solutions and competition from outside EU.  
Unless otherwise agreed with the granting authority, beneficiaries must ensure that none of 
the entities that participate as subcontractors are established in countries which are not eligible 
as set out in the call conditions. 
The consortium as a whole and individual beneficiaries should ensure that, for a period of up 
to four years after the end of the project, supply and availability of the hardware, 
manufacturing, assembly processes developed and/or qualified within the project should be 
made available to any entity in the EU plus Norway and Iceland, at fair and reasonable market 
prices and conditions and with no legal restrictions and limitations stemming for example 
from International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) or equivalent instruments applicable 
in non-EU jurisdictions. Additionally, beneficiaries that intend to transfer ownership or grant 
an exclusive licence must formally notify the granting authority before the intended transfer 
or licensing takes place; the granting authority may, up to four years after the end of the 
project, object to a transfer of ownership or the exclusive licensing of results. 
In this topic, the integration of the gender dimension (sex and gender analysis) in research and 
innovation content is not relevant.
