The Commission estimates that an EU contribution of around EUR 4.50 
million would allow these outcomes to be addressed appropriately. 
Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of a 
proposal requesting different amounts. 
Indicative budget The total indicative budget for the topic is EUR 9.00 million. 
Type of Action Innovation Actions 
Eligibility 
conditions 
The conditions are described in General Annex B. The following 
exceptions apply: 
In line with the “ restriction on control in innovation actions in critical 
technology areas ” delineated in General Annex B of the General 
Annexes, entities established in an eligible country but which are 
directly or indirectly controlled by China or by a legal entity established 
in China are not eligible to participate in the action. 
This topic requires involvement as beneficiaries of at least 3 relevant 
practitioners from EU Member States or Associated Countries. 
Depending on the specific proposal submitted, these practitioners should 
represent one or several of the following portfolios: 
• critical infrastructure operator, 
• authority responsible for critical infrastructure resilience, 
• civil protection authority, 
• first responders’ organisations or agencies, 
• authority in charge of managing NaTech (Natural Hazard 
Triggered Technological) events, 
• law enforcement or private companies providing security for 
critical infrastructure. 
For these participants, applicants must fill in the table “Information 
about security practitioners” in the application form with all the 
requested information, following the template provided in the 
submission IT tool. 
If projects use satellite -based earth observation, positioning, navigation 
and/or related timing data and services, beneficiaries must make use of 
Copernicus and/or Galileo/EGNOS (other data and services may 
additionally be used). 
Technology 
Readiness Level 
Activities are expected to achieve TRL 6 -7 by the end of the project – 
see General Annex B. 
Legal and 
financial set-up of 
the Grant 
Agreements 
The rules are described in General Annex G. The following exceptions 
apply: 
The granting authority may, up to 4 years after the end of the action, 
object to a transfer of ownership or to the exclusive licensing of results, 
as set out in the specific provision of Annex 5. 
Eligible costs will take the form of a lump sum as defined in the 
Decision of 7 July 2021 authorising the use of lump sum contributions 
under the Horizon Europe Programme – the Framework Programme for 
Research and Innovation (2021 -2027) – and in actions under the 
Research and Training Programme of the European Atomic Energy 
Community (2021-2025) 103. 
Security Sensitive 
Topics 
Some activities resulting from this topic may involve using classified 
background and/or producing of security sensitive results (EUCI and 
 
SEN). Please refer to the related provisions in section B Security — EU 
classified and sensitive information of the General Annexes. 
 
Expected Outcome: Project results are expected to contribute to some or all of the following 
outcomes: 
• Improved understanding of systemic vulnerabilities of critical entities including physical, 
digital, operational, and cross-sectoral dimensions, in the face of compound natural and 
human-made disaster risks; 
• Verification of existing measures countering potential NaTech risks; 
• Demonstration of advanced technological solutions that enhance the ability of public and 
private providers of critical services to prepare for, respond to, and recover from 
complex, multi-hazard scenarios, including cascading or hybrid NaTech events; 
• Deployment of common platforms and operational tools for dynamic risk assessment, 
decision support, between public authorities, first responders, and critical infrastructure 
operators during disruptive events; 
• Strengthened multi -level and cross -border cooperation frameworks for integrated 
emergency and continuity management, ensuring seamless coordination across sectors, 
governance levels, and jurisdictions.  
Scope: Recent compound and cascading disasters have demonstrated the urgent need to 
reinforce the resilience of critical entities against a wide spectrum of hazards, including both 
human-induced incidents, natural events such as floods, wildfires, earthquakes, and storms, 
and natural hazard triggered technological (NaTech) accidents, including hybrid scenarios. 
The vulnerability of key infrastructures is exacerbated by their growing interdependencies and 
the systemic propagation of risks across sectors and borders. In this context, ensuring the 
monitoring, protection and continuity of essential services has become fundamental to 
preserving and enhancing societal resilience. 
This topic aims to support the development and demonstration of targeted high -tech 
capabilities that address specific preparedness, operational, and recovery gaps in the resilience 
of critical entities 104 under multi-hazard and NaTech conditions. It calls for moving beyond 
generic resilience frameworks toward sector -specific, interoperable, and modular 
technological and governance solutions that can be deployed and tested in realistic operational 
settings. 
Proposals should be grounded in existing risk assessments and draw on lessons learned from 
recent disruptive events. They are expected to deliver measurable improvements in both 
technological and organisational resilience through the identification and prioritisation of 
critical capability gaps, especially where cascading and cross -sectoral risks are likely to arise. 
 
In parallel, adaptive continuity planning and decision -making tools should be designed to 
enhance situational awareness, support dynamic response coordination, and maintain service 
continuity in fast-evolving crisis scenarios.  
Proposals should also demonstrate cross -border, multi -actor coordination mechanisms 
through simulations or testing in real operational environments, involving public authorities, 
emergency responders, and critical service operators or representative environments where 
critical infrastructure is particularly exposed to multi-hazard risks. 
International cooperation is encouraged, particularly in regions with cross -border 
infrastructure or shared vulnerabilities. Actions should take due account of the relevant EU 
legal and policy frameworks and are expected to address all applicable considerations 
expressed in the Introductions of the Resilient Infrastructure and Disaster -Resilient Society 
for Europe Destinations. 
Coordination among the successful proposals from this topic and projects funded under 
HORIZON-CL3-2025-01-INFRA-01: Open topic for improved preparedness for, response to 
and recovery from large -scale disruptions of critical infrastructures  and HORIZON -CL3-
2025-01-INFRA-02: Open topic for role of the human factor for resilience of European 
critical entities, and HORIZON-CL3-2024-DRS-01-04: Hi-tech capacities for crisis response 
and recovery after a natural -technological (NaTech) disaster should be envisaged in order to 
avoid duplication, share resources and exploit complementarities and opportunities for 
increased impact.
