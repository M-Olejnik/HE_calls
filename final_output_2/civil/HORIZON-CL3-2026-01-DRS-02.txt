Expected Outcome: Project results are expected to contribute to some or all  of the following 
expected outcomes: 
• Integrated single-hazard systems into multi -hazard next generation predictive models to 
assess cascading effects (e.g., heatwave, floods, droughts, landslides, heavy rain) and 
interactions across meteorological, geophysical, and technological hazards; 
• Enhanced hazard forecasting and response through research on model integration and 
platform interoperability; 
• Development of holistic risk and resilience metrics to support multi -hazard prevention 
strategies, encompassing main physical, economic and social effects; 
• Improvement of analysis models considering evolving vulnerability state, due to 
cascading and cumulative effects, through numerical simulations and experimental tests, 
possibly also supported by AI applications; 
• Collected reliable data (same granularity and format) and ways to share and analyse it. 
The interoperability of all kinds of systems and information sharing is crucial, based on 
the need-to-know principle; 
• Improved knowledge/experience -sharing from past emergencies to cope with future 
emergencies, also strengthening trans-national knowledge and data exchange among EU 
countries as well as from early warning to early action; 
• Improved disaster risk and resilience management due to single/multiple threats through 
a holistic, systemic and cross -cutting approach, also considering relevant changes such 
as changing climate, digital transformation, environmental and socio -economic 
conditions; 
• Development of holistic Risk and Resilience Metrics to support multi -hazard prevention 
strategies, encompassing main physical, economic and social effects; 
• Solutions shall include the analysis of the physical, social and governance systems and 
take into account the development of an EU comprehensive risks and threats assessment.  
 
Scope: Advancing multi-hazard risk assessment and disaster resilience is a necessity. Building 
on the integrated all-hazard approach, the advancement will be achieved by integrating single-
hazard models into next -generation predictive systems capable of analysing cascading and 
cumulative effects. A key focus should be on early and anticipatory action, improving the 
understanding of interactions between meteorological, geophysical, and technological 
hazards, including their compounding impacts on societies, economies, and critical 
infrastructure. 
Proposals should aim to develop and validate integrated forecasting models, that enhance the 
prediction and management of multi -hazard scenarios, supports flexibility and extensibility, 
and coordination of responses by incorporating real -time data, AI -driven analytics, and 
remote sensing technologies. These models should facilitate improved hazard forecasting by 
addressing challenges in platform interoperability and data exchange, ensuring that diverse 
hazard monitoring systems at local, national, and global levels can effectively communicate 
and operate in synergy. 
Efforts should also explore the interoperability of regional and national hazard warning 
systems, enhancing global forecasting capabilities for hazards such as landslides triggered by 
extreme weather events, or cumulative damage modelling for earthquakes and their 
aftershocks. Research should address gaps in loss estimation models by considering the 
cascading and long-term impacts of disasters on infrastructure, the built environment, supply 
chains, and diverse needs of communities. Furthermore, proposals should contribute to the 
development of advanced tools and methodologies to assess the combined effects of multiple 
hazards on critical infrastructure, ensuring that disaster risk management strategies account 
for interdependencies across sectors This should include scenario -based stress testing, digital 
twins for risk modelling, and AI -powered decision -support systems, taking into account 
existing biases, to enhance resilience planning for lifeline services such as energy, water, 
transport and telecommunications. 
A holistic, systemic, and cross -cutting approach should be applied to disaster risk 
management, taking into consideration climate change trends, environmental degradation, and 
vulnerabilities such as gender, age, disabilities and others social factors. The topic should lead 
to the creation of comprehensive Risk and Resilience Metrics, integrating physical, economic, 
and social dimensions to support decision -makers in designing effective prevention and 
adaptation strategies. Considering building on and leveraging from existing systems, such as 
the Copernicus Emergency Management Service (CEMS) the Destination Earth Platform or 
Risk Data Hub, could be beneficial. 
Projects should conduct a stakeholder or market analysis and a roadmap or plan for uptake of 
the developed methodologies, findings, and technologies to the industry, the research and 
innovation community, and/or the relevant authorities. 
Projects may take into account the assets but also particular challenges faced by the European 
outermost regions and may include entities from these regions in the consortium’s 
composition. 
Projects should contribute to strengthening risk governance at multiple levels by fostering 
collaboration between scientific communities, policymakers, emergency responders, and 
infrastructure operators. Efforts should be made in leveraging citizens -generated content in 
social media and decentralised digital platforms for citizen -driven early warning and 
situational awareness. Alignment with EU policies, international risk reduction frameworks, 
and best practices in resilience planning should be ensured, maximizing the applicability and 
impact of the developed solutions. The Preparedness Union Strategy is a key document in this 
regard and includes a key action on developing an EU comprehensive risks and threats 
assessment. Finding synergies with projects from operational grants, such as the Knowledge 
for Action in Prevention & Preparedness (KAPP)120, is recommended. 
Where applicable, proposals should leverage the data and services available through European 
Research Infrastructures federated under the European Open Science Cloud, as well as data 
from relevant Data Spaces. Particular efforts should be made to ensure that the data produced 
in the context of this topic is FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Re-usable).
