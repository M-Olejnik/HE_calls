HORIZON-CL3-2026-01-FCT-02: Open topic on preventing and countering the misuse 
of emerging technologies for criminal purposes, including issues related to lawful access 
to data 
Call: Civil Security for Society 2026 
Specific conditions 
Expected EU 
contribution per 
project 
The Commission estimates that an EU contribution of around EUR 4.50 
million would allow these outcomes to be addressed appropriately. 
Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of a 
proposal requesting different amounts. 
Indicative budget The total indicative budget for the topic is EUR 9.00 million. 
Type of Action Research and Innovation Actions 
Eligibility 
conditions 
The conditions are described in General Annex B. The following 
exceptions apply: 
The following additional eligibility criteria apply: 
This topic requires the active involvement, as beneficiaries, of at least 2 
Police Authorities 37  from at least 2 different EU Member States or 
Associated Countries. For these participants, applicants must fill in the 
table “Information about security practitioners” in the application form 
with all the requested information, following the template provided in 
the submission IT tool. 
Subject to restrictions for the protection of European communication 
networks. 
If projects use satellite -based earth observation, positioning, navigation 
and/or related timing data and services, beneficiaries must make use of 
Copernicus and/or Galileo/EGNOS (other data and services may 
additionally be used). 
Technology 
Readiness Level 
Activities are expected to achieve TRL 5 by the end of the project – see 
General Annex B. 
Legal and 
financial set-up of 
the Grant 
Agreements 
The rules are described in General Annex G. The following exceptions 
apply: 
The granting authority may, up to 4 years after the end of the action, 
object to a transfer of ownership or to the exclusive licensing of results, 
as set out in the specific provision of Annex 5. 
Eligible costs will take the form of a lump sum as defined in the 
Decision of 7 July 2021 authorising the use of lump sum contributions 
under the Horizon Europe Programme – the Framework Programme for 
Research and Innovation (2021 -2027) – and in actions under the 
Research and Training Programme of the European Atomic Energy 
Community (2021-2025) 38. 
Security Sensitive Some activities resulting from this topic may involve using classified 
background and/or producing of security sensitive results (EUCI and 
 
Topics SEN). Please refer to the related provisions in section B Security — EU 
classified and sensitive information of the General Annexes. 
 
Expected Outcome: Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected 
outcomes: 
• Police Authorities in Europe are empowered with modern, accessible and validated 
tools, methodologies and training curricula to anticipate and cope with the misuse of new 
and emerging technologies for criminal purposes, with the aim to facilitate prevention, 
detection, efficient data access and investigation of criminal offences in a lawful manner 
and with full respect of fundamental rights, including the right to protection of personal 
data and to privacy; 
• Reinforced interdisciplinary collaboration at the European level through the 
establishment of partnerships among technologists, policymakers and Police Authorities, 
resulting in a holistic understanding of the challenges posed by emerging technologies 
and in sharing of best practices; 
• Clear guidelines and frameworks are created, including on procedures and rules, that 
ensure lawful access to data, balancing the needs of security with respect for privacy and 
that foster a European approach to the related challenges for the police and the judiciary.   
Scope: New and emerging technologies (e.g., new communication technologies, quantum 
technologies, new biometrics and identification technologies, cloud computing technologies, 
generative AI etc.) bring many benefits but also pose a number of new challenges for the 
police and the judiciary. Therefore, there is a strong need to adequately tackle challenges for 
Police Authorities stemming from all these new and emerging developments as well as to 
make sure that the lawful access to data keeps track with these evolutions, respecting 
applicable legislation and fundamental rights such as personal data protection and privacy. 
Under the Open topic, proposals are welcome to address new and emerging technologies that 
are not covered by the other projects of the previous Horizon Europe Calls Fighting Crime 
and Terrorism, as well as of the current Call Fighting Crime and Terrorism 2026 -2027. 
Proposals should emphasize adaptive methodologies and frameworks that can evolve in 
response to new threats and challenges, empowering Police Authorities to act effectively 
while ensuring adherence to legal standards regarding data access. Thus, research activities 
proposed within this topic should, in a balanced way, 1) develop modern tools, methodologies 
and training material for police to tackle the problem of misuse for criminal purposes of the 
new and emerging technologies under consideration, and 2) address issues related to lawful 
access to data in this context. 
In this topic the integration of the gender and intersectional dimension (sex and gender 
analysis) in research and innovation content is not a mandatory requirement. Coordination 
among the successful proposals from this topic should be envisaged to avoid duplication and 
to exploit complementarities as well as opportunities for increased impact. 
The proposals funded under this topic that concern issues which are within the mandate of 
Europol39 are expected to engage with the Europol Innovation Lab during the lifetime of the 
project, including validating the outcomes, with the aim of facilitating future uptake of 
innovations for the law enforcement community. Similarly, if the proposals concern drug -
related issues, they are expected to engage with the EU Drugs Agency during the lifetime of 
the project, including validating the outcomes. For Police Authorities’ training -related 
aspects, cooperation of successful proposals with CEPOL is expected, provided that the 
Agency opts out from applying for funding. 
Finally, proposals are expected to address all applicable considerations expressed in the 
Introduction of the Fighting Crime and Terrorism Destination.
