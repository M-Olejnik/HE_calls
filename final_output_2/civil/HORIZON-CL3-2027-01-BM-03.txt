Beneficiaries must provide financial support to third parties. The 
support to third parties can only be provided in the form of grants. The 
maximum amount to be granted to each third party is EUR 100 000 to 
support the expected outcomes of the topic and effective collaboration 
and/or coordination with additional relevant national Customs 
Authorities, including testing and validation activities within the 
 
projects; the organisation of testing and validation activities also 
justifies the maximum amount to be granted to each third party 
indicated above. 
Security Sensitive 
Topics 
Some activities resulting from this topic may involve using classified 
background and/or producing of security sensitive results (EUCI and 
SEN). Please refer to the related provisions in section B Security — EU 
classified and sensitive information of the General Annexes. 
 
Expected Outcome: Project results are expected to contribute to some or all  of the following 
expected outcomes: 
• Increased security of air, maritime, land, or postal transport, cargo and supply chain; 
• Address accidental or intentional explosions, fires, noxious chemicals, material 
degradation, or autonomous threats in cargo; 
• Enhanced capabilities to detect, characterise, track and trace, and seize dangerous, 
regulated, illicit devices, goods, or material; 
• Increased mobility of the customs authorities’ resources and equipment and improved 
agility for a faster and more coordinated response; 
• Interoperability of customs control equipment and interconnectivity with other systems, 
including integration of logistical operations, and/or increased inter -agency and cross 
border collaboration.   
Scope: Today’s global economy and high -volume trade flows require much and fast transport 
to deliver products worldwide. Traders and consumers expect quick and easy transactions, 
while customs administrations face the challenge of controlling the goods without disrupting 
their flow. This is exploited by organised crime and terrorist organisations, which take 
advantage of the large amount of goods to conceal threats or illegal and/or dangerous 
materials in legal commercial cargo, with the aim of causing damage, disruption, or of it 
illegally crossing borders unnoticed. 
Customs authorities must ensure a high level of compliance with both security and revenue 
objectives: trafficked materials may represent a threat, and undetected smuggled licit 
materials entering the EU deprive the Member States of the revenue due if the material had 
been legally traded. In addition, illegal trafficking can have an impact in the environment 
(such as biodiversity loss or deforestation) or for the EU citizens’ safety and health. 
The air and maritime cargo contexts present security challenges as well as high potential 
consequences of threats, primarily but not limited to explosives and incendiary devices. Air 
cargo can represent continuity assurances to cope, at least in the short term and for critical 
lines, with supply chain and/or distribution crises; while maritime cargo remains the most 
common transport mode in global trade. The risk for well -concealed materials not being 
detected during screening, or the risk of concealment during the supply chain is pressing. 
Logistical hubs also need to strengthen their capabilities to adapt to sudden changes, and 
customs authorities need to mobilise their available resources to ensure efficient and fast 
controls. The need for better mobility and improved agility for customs is accompanied by the 
need to deploy scalable solutions, that are interoperable with other systems to facilitate co -
sharing of equipment between BCPs and between Member States. 
Innovation actions funded under this topic should develop and test solutions for cargo 
security, relevant to one or more transport modes (maritime, air, postal, road, or rail); and 
usable at one (or more) crucial point(s) of the supply chain. Innovation can also develop 
enhanced capabilities for customs to detect illicit, regulated and / or dangerous goods and 
transactions, and to be able to effectively characterise them in a timely manner. Improved 
tracking and tracing capabilities will facilitate the seizing of the materials while contributing 
to collecting data and evidence to further support investigations and prosecutions. 
Proposals are expected to address one of the following options that should be explicitly 
selected: 
Option a: security of cargo 
Option b: detection of smuggled and trafficked goods/materials in cargo 
Detection capabilities should target one or more type(s) of dangerous, illicit and/or illegal 
goods or materials, including: explosive or incendiary devices; illicit drugs and their 
precursors; illegally traded species, including covered by the Convention on International 
Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) and considering the 
Regulation on Deforestation -free Products 81; illegally traded cultural property; contraband; 
trafficked weapons; chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear and explosive (CBRN -E) 
material or precursors; F -gases; and/or various modi operandi related to cross -border 
trafficking, including involving cargo. 
Where the identification of illegal goods cannot be achieved without opening containers (for 
example, in the case of species or their parts), and where imagery, chemical, or molecular 
tests are required, appropriate measures should be established to reduce the response time 
between sampling and expert assessment, thereby minimizing disruption to the flow of goods. 
Examples of technologies and approaches that can be explored by the research actions include 
(non-prescriptive and non -exhaustive): smart active defuse systems, sensors, artificial 
intelligence, tracking and tracing systems, distributed ledger technologies, non -intrusive 
inspection, automated threat recognition systems, and screening and scanning systems. 
Equipment and technologies enabling increased security of cargo should contribute to cost 
and energy efficiency, limit their environmental impact and being more sustainable when they 
will be taken up in the future. An increased security of air cargo, furthermore, should not be 
regarded as an incentive to use air transport when this has a higher environmental and 
emissions impact, but prioritised on critical supply lines and/or situations. 
 
Proposals received under this topic should demonstrate how the project would integrate the 
perspective for the whole supply chain, from load to delivery. Proposed solutions should be 
interoperable with the different relevant equipment and systems deployed by the customs 
authorities. Proposals should demonstrate how their solutions would align with existing 
interoperability standards (if any), and consider issues of cybersecurity and EU technological 
sovereignty and strategic autonomy. Proposals submitted under this topic are expected to 
align with the customs reform (if adopted) and customs policy priorities, and the projects 
should, once started, align with the policy priorities of the proposed EU Customs Authority 
and its Data Hub (if established). 
Coordination among the successful proposals from this topic should be envisaged to avoid 
duplication and to exploit complementarities as well as opportunities for increased impact. To 
ensure the active involvement of and timely feedback from relevant security practitioners, 
proposals should plan a mid -term deliverable consisting in the assessment of the project’s 
mid-term outcomes, performed by the practitioners involved in the project. 
Research projects should consider, build on (if appropriate) and not duplicate previous 
research, including but not limited to research by other relevant EU Framework Programmes 
projects on security research. 
Proposals should delineate the plans for further development to subsequent TRLs as well as 
uptake (industrialisation, commercialisation, acquisition and/or deployment) at national and 
EU level, should the research deliver on its goals. The results of the research should be taken 
up by EU customs authorities with the support of the Customs Control Equipment Instrument 
(CCEI) and/or subsequent funding opportunities, or the proposed EU Customs Authority and 
its Data Hub (once established). 
Synergies within civil security can be an asset, for example with Better protect the EU and its 
citizens against Crime and Terrorism and Resilient Infrastructure.
