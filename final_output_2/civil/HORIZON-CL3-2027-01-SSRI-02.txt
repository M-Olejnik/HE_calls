HORIZON-CL3-2027-01-SSRI-02: Open grounds for future pre -commercial 
procurement of innovative security technologies 
Call: Civil Security for Society 2027 
Specific conditions 
Expected EU 
contribution per 
project 
The Commission estimates that an EU contribution of around EUR 1.00 
million would allow these outcomes to be addressed appropriately. 
Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of a 
proposal requesting different amounts. 
Indicative budget The total indicative budget for the topic is EUR 2.00 million. 
Type of Action Coordination and Support Actions 
Eligibility 
conditions 
The conditions are described in General Annex B. The following 
exceptions apply: 
Subject to restrictions for the protection of European communication 
networks. 
The following additional eligibility conditions apply: 
This topic requires the participation, as beneficiaries, of at least 6 end -
user organisations as well as at least 3 public procurers. One beneficiary 
can have the role of end -user and public procurer simultaneously, both 
counting towards the number of such entities required for the additional 
eligibility condition. These beneficiaries must be from at least 3 
different EU Member States or Associated Countries. For these 
participants, applicants must fill in the table “Information about security 
 
practitioners” in the application form with all the requested information, 
following the template provided in the submission IT tool. 
Open market consultations carried out during this project must take 
place in at least 3 EU Member States or Associated Countries. 
Legal and 
financial set-up of 
the Grant 
Agreements 
The rules are described in General Annex G. The following exceptions 
apply: 
Eligible costs will take the form of a lump sum as defined in the 
Decision of 7 July 2021 authorising the use of lump sum contributions 
under the Horizon Europe Programme – the Framework Programme for 
Research and Innovation (2021 -2027) – and in actions under the 
Research and Training Programme of the European Atomic Energy 
Community (2021-2025) 175. 
 
Expected Outcome: Project results are expected to contribute to some or all  of the following 
expected outcomes: 
• Establish a consolidated group of potential buyers with shared needs and requirements, 
committed to carrying out a pre -commercial procurement (PCP) action for future joint 
procurement of innovative solutions; 
• Evidence for Future PCP Action: Provide clear evidence justifying the necessity of a 
PCP action to complete the maturation cycle of certain technologies and compare 
different alternatives; 
• Increased capacity of EU public procurers to align requirements with industry and future 
products and to attract innovation and innovators from security and other sectors through 
common validation strategies, rapid innovation, experimentation and pre -commercial 
procurement.  
Scope: End-users and public procurers from several countries are invited to submit proposals 
for a preparatory action that should build the grounds for a future pre -commercial 
procurement (PCP) action. Both this preparatory action and the future PCP action are open to 
proposals oriented to the acquisition of research and development (R&D) services for the 
development of innovative technologies, systems, tools or techniques under the priorities laid 
down in this Work Programme. 
In preparing the grounds for a possible future PCP action, the outputs of this Coordination and 
Support Action (CSA) should take into consideration: 
 
• The policy priorities described in this Work Programme Part for the security areas 
mentioned above; 
• The EU Directive for public procurement and in particular with the provisions related to 
PCP; 
• The specific provisions and funding rates of PCP actions and the specific requirements 
for innovation procurement (PCP/PPI) supported by Horizon Europe grants, as stated in 
the General Annex H of the Horizon Europe Work Programme; 
• The guidance for attracting innovators and innovation, as explained in the European 
Commission Guidance on Innovation Procurement C(2021) 4320, in particular those 
measures oriented to reduce the barriers to high-tech start-ups and innovative SMEs.  
During the course of the project, the applicants are expected to deliver clear evidence on a 
number of aspects in order to justify and de-risk a possible follow-up PCP action, including: 
• That the challenge is pertinent and that indeed a PCP action is required to complete the 
maturation cycle of certain technologies and to compare different alternatives; 
• That there is a consolidated group of potential buyers with common needs and 
requirements which are committed to carry out a PCP action in order to be able to take 
an informed decision on a future joint procurement of innovative solutions; 
• That there is a quantifiable and identifiable community of potential buyers (including 
and beyond those proposed as beneficiaries in the proposal) who would share to a wide 
extent the common needs and requirements defined and who could be interested in 
exploring further joint -uptake of solutions similar to those developed under the PCP, 
should these prove to be technologically mature and operationally relevant by the end of 
the project; 
• That the state of the art and the market (including research) has been explored and 
mapped, and that there are different technical alternatives to address the proposed 
challenge; 
• That a future PCP tendering process is clear, that a draft planning has been proposed and 
that the supporting documentation and administrative procedures will be ready on due 
time in order to launch the call for the acquisition of R&D services according to the PCP 
rules; 
• That the technology developments to be conducted in the future PCP can be done in 
compliance with European societal values, fundamental rights and applicable legislation, 
including in the area of free movement of persons, privacy and protection of personal 
data;
• That in developing technology solutions, societal and gender aspects (e.g., perception of 
security, possible side effects of technological solutions, societal resilience) are taken 
into account in a comprehensive and thorough manner.  
If the applicants intend to submit a proposal for a follow -up PCP in a future Horizon Europe 
Cluster 3 Work Programme, they should ensure that the above evidence is consolidated in the 
project deliverables of this CSA before the submission of the PCP proposal. 
The project should have a maximum estimated duration of 1 year. 
Finally, proposals are expected to address all applicable considerations expressed in the 
Introduction of the Strengthened Security Research and Innovation Destination.
