Specific conditions 
Expected EU 
contribution per 
project 
The Commission estimates that an EU contribution of around EUR 3.00 
million would allow these outcomes to be addressed appropriately.

proposal requesting different amounts. 
Indicative budget The total indicative budget for the topic is EUR 6.00 million. 
Type of Action Research and Innovation Actions 
Eligibility

and/or related timing data and services, beneficiaries must make use of 
Copernicus and/or Galileo/EGNOS (other data and services may 
additionally be used). 
Technology Activities are expected to achieve TRL 5 by the end of the project – see 
 
Readiness Level General Annex B. 
Legal and 
financial set-up of 
the Grant 
Agreements 
The rules are described in General Annex G. The following exceptions 
apply: 
The granting authority may, up to 4 years after the end of the action, 
object to a transfer of ownership or to the exclusive licensing of results, 
as set out in the specific provision of Annex 5. 
Eligible costs will take the form of a lump sum as defined in the 
Decision of 7 July 2021 authorising the use of lump sum contributions 
under the Horizon Europe Programme – the Framework Programme for 
Research and Innovation (2021 -2027) – and in actions under the 
Research and Training Programme of the European Atomic Energy 
Community (2021-2025) 43. 
Security Sensitive 
Topics 
Some activities resulting from this topic may involve using classified 
background and/or producing of security sensitive results (EUCI and 
SEN). Please refer to the related provisions in section B Security — EU 
classified and sensitive information of the General Annexes. 
 
Expected Outcome: Project results are expected to contribute to some or all  of the following 
expected outcomes: 
• Improved understanding of links between addictions and crime, including drivers of 
criminality; 
• Innovative and effective solutions, including training curricula, for Police Authorities in 
Europe and relevant Civil Society Organisations (or Non -Governmental Organisations) 
to prevent addictions and related crimes, with a special attention to young people at risk; 
• Evidence-based support to modernising European criminal justice system’s approach 
when dealing with addiction-related offenses; 
• Novel approaches of collaboration between different stakeholders, primarily Police 
Authorities in Europe and Civil Society Organisations (or Non -Governmental 
Organisations), to increase communities’ addiction resilience, security and safety.   
Scope: A close and complex relationship exists between addictions, such as gambling, drug or 
alcohol use, and crime (e.g., criminals are often under the influence of drugs while 
committing crimes, gamblers or drug users commit crimes to pay for their debts or drugs). In 
this topic, successful proposals are expected to analyse the specific nexus between addictions 
and crime, with the aim of developing related modern methodologies and tools for prevention 
of not only addictions but also crimes related to them, both offline and online, while 
 
respecting the fundamental rights of the communities concerned and using of non -
stigmatising language. Novel approaches of collaboration between different community 
stakeholders, from Police Authorities, civil society, national and local entities, private actors, 
trained psychologists, are expected to be developed as well, with the aim of increasing 
communities’ addiction resilience, security and safety. An emphasis of the work should be on 
young people at risk, the criminal justice system, drivers of criminality and pathways from 
committing a petty crime because of addiction to progressively getting involved in organised 
crime. Activities proposed within this topic should address the issue from various angles, 
combining both social research with technological development and applications in a logical 
manner. 
Therefore, this topic requires the effective contribution of Social Sciences and Humanities 
(SSH) disciplines and the involvement of SSH experts, institutions as well as the inclusion of 
relevant SSH expertise, in order to produce meaningful and significant effects enhancing the 
societal impact of the related research activities. Also, incorporating a gender -sensitive 
approach will allow to better understand the relationships between addiction, crime, and 
gender, leading to more effective interventions that address the specific needs of men, 
women, and marginalized groups.  
Proposals should outline the plans to develop possible future uptake and upscaling at national 
and EU level for possible next steps once the project is finalised. Proposals should also 
consider, build on if appropriate and not duplicate previous research. Coordination among the 
successful proposals from this topic should be envisaged to avoid duplication and to exploit 
complementarities as well as opportunities for increased impact. 
Furthermore, proposals funded under this topic are expected to provide ideas on how they 
would engage with the European Union Drugs Agency (EUDA) during the lifetime of the 
project, including validating the outcomes, with the aim of facilitating future uptake of 
innovations. For aspects of training of Police Authorities, cooperation of successful proposals 
with CEPOL is expected, provided that the Agency opts out from applying for funding. 
Finally, proposals are expected to address all applicable considerations expressed in the 
Introduction of the Fighting Crime and Terrorism Destination.
