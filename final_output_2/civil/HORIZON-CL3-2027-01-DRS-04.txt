Readiness Level 
Activities are expected to achieve TRL 8 by the end of the project – see 
General Annex B. 
Legal and 
financial set-up of 
the Grant 
Agreements 
The rules are described in General Annex G. The following exceptions 
apply: 
The granting authority may, up to 4 years after the end of the action, 
object to a transfer of ownership or to the exclusive licensing of results, 
as set out in the specific provision of Annex 5. 
Eligible costs will take the form of a lump sum as defined in the 
Decision of 7 July 2021 authorising the use of lump sum contributions 
under the Horizon Europe Programme – the Framework Programme for 
Research and Innovation (2021 -2027) – and in actions under the 
Research and Training Programme of the European Atomic Energy 
Community (2021-2025) 150. 
Security Sensitive 
Topics 
Some activities resulting from this topic may involve using classified 
background and/or producing of security sensitive results (EUCI and 
SEN). Please refer to the related provisions in section B Security — EU 
classified and sensitive information of the General Annexes. 
 
Expected Outcome: Project results are expected to contribute to some or all  of the following 
expected outcomes: 
• Utilization of virtual and augmented reality training to simulate large -scale and 
transboundary disasters, improving disaster management’s readiness and response 
capabilities; 
• Development of diverse crisis scenarios using VR/AR technology, providing immersive, 
practical training experiences for emergency personnel, responders and decision makers; 
 
appropriate legal or administrative acts, a formal mandate to design, coordinate, or implement disaster 
risk prevention, preparedness, response or crisis communication measures. 
• Strengthened ability of responders and decision -makers to manage large -scale, cross -
border disaster scenarios through advanced, technology-driven training programs; 
• Improved knowledge/experience -sharing from past emergencies to cope with future 
emergencies, also strengthening trans-national knowledge and data exchange among EU 
countries as well as from early warning to early action.   
Scope: The scope of this topic is on enhancing preparedness for large -scale, cross -border 
disasters by leveraging advanced training methodologies, including virtual reality (VR) and 
augmented reality (AR) simulations and Digital Twins. The objective is to improve the 
readiness and response capabilities of disaster responders and emergency management 
personnel by providing immersive, technology -driven training experiences that replicate 
complex disaster scenarios. 
Proposals should develop and validate innovative VR/AR -based crisis simulation models that 
can accurately depict diverse large -scale disaster situations, including transboundary hazards 
such as wildfires, floods, earthquakes, and industrial accidents. These simulations should 
incorporate near real -time data, AI -driven scenario adaptation, and multi -user interaction 
capabilities to ensure realistic, high -impact training exercises. Special attention should be 
given to the interoperability of these training platforms, allowing emergency services from 
different regions and countries to collaborate in joint preparedness exercises. 
Recommendations taken into account a gender -sensitive approaches should also improve 
crisis simulations by considering diverse needs and experiences. 
Research should also explore how digital training environments can enhance situational 
awareness, decision -making, and coordination among disaster management and relevant 
authorities. The integration of gamification techniques, AI -driven coaching systems, and real-
time performance assessment should be considered to maximize learning outcomes and 
adaptation to evolving crisis scenarios linking to previous themes (e.g. biometrics and long -
lasting disturbance, or whole of the society security, multi-hazard theme etc.). 
Furthermore, proposals should focus on strengthening knowledge and experience -sharing 
mechanisms across EU member states by developing transnational training frameworks and 
crisis management protocols, in coordination with the UCPM Training Programme 151. This 
should include the establishment of digital platforms and collaborative networks to facilitate 
the exchange of lessons learned from past emergencies, fostering continuous improvement in 
disaster response strategies. 
Projects should conduct a stakeholder or market analysis and a roadmap or plan for uptake of 
the developed methodologies, findings, and technologies to the industry, the research and 
innovation community, and/or the relevant authorities. 
Ethical, legal, and social aspects related to the use of immersive training technologies should 
also be addressed, ensuring compliance with data protection regulations and maximizing 
public trust in the adoption of these tools. Trust should also refer to the security of the tools, 
 
that should include appropriate measures for resilience against emerging cryptographic 
threats. Projects should align with existing EU disaster risk reduction policies and 
international best practices to ensure the practical applicability and scalability of the 
developed solutions. The Preparedness Union Strategy is a key document in this regard. Its 
key action on “Develop an EU catalogue for training and a platform for lessons learned” and 
existing platforms should be taken into account in the proposal. Analysing capacity gaps of 
the UCPM 152  and finding synergies with projects from operational grants, such as the 
Knowledge for Action in Prevention & Preparedness (KAPP)153, is recommended. 
Where applicable, proposals should leverage the data and services available through European 
Research Infrastructures federated under the European Open Science Cloud, Copernicus, 
Destination Earth as well as data from relevant Data Spaces. Particular efforts should be made 
to ensure that the data produced in the context of this topic is FAIR (Findable, Accessible, 
Interoperable and Re-usable).
