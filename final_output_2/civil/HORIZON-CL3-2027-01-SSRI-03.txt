Specific conditions 
Expected EU 
contribution per 
project 
The Commission estimates that an EU contribution of around EUR 5.83 
million would allow these outcomes to be addressed appropriately. 
Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of a 
proposal requesting different amounts. 
Indicative budget The total indicative budget for the topic is EUR 5.83 million. 
Type of Action Pre-commercial Procurement 
Eligibility 
conditions 
The conditions are described in General Annex B. The following 
exceptions apply: 
Subject to restrictions for the protection of European communication 
networks. 
The following additional eligibility conditions apply: 
This topic requires the participation 176, as beneficiaries, of at least 3 
practitioners and 3 public procurers. These beneficiaries must be from at 
least 3 different EU Member States or Associated Countries. One 
organisation can have the role of practitioner and public procurer 
simultaneously, both counting for the overall number of organisations 
required for eligibility. Among the public procurers 177, minimum two 
must be independent legal entities that are public procurers, each 
established in a different Member State or Associated Country and with 
 
at least one of them established in a Member State. 
For participants with practitioner status, applicants must fill in the table 
“Information about security practitioners” in the application form with 
all the requested information, following the template provided in the 
submission IT tool. 
If projects use satellite -based earth observation, positioning, navigation 
and/or related timing data and services, beneficiaries must make use of 
Copernicus and/or Galileo/EGNOS (other data and services may 
additionally be used). 
Technology 
Readiness Level 
Activities are expected to achieve TRL 6 -8 by the end of the project – 
see General Annex B. 
Legal and 
financial set-up of 
the Grant 
Agreements 
The rules are described in General Annex G. The following exceptions 
apply: 
The granting authority may, up to 4 years after the end of the action, 
object to a transfer of ownership or to the exclusive licensing of results, 
as set out in the specific provision of Annex 5. 
Beneficiaries may provide financial support to third parties. The support 
to third parties can only be provided in the form of grants / prizes. The 
maximum amount to be granted to each third party is EUR 100 000 to 
provide financial incentives to final end -users that are not part of the 
consortium (e.g., citizens) to adopt the solutions, including costly 
hardware components. 
PCP/PPI procurement costs are eligible. 
The specific conditions for actions with PCP/PPI procurements in 
section H of the General Annexes apply to grants funded under this 
topic. 
Beneficiaries must ensure that the subcontracted work is performed in at 
least 3 Member States — unless otherwise approved by the granting 
authority. 
 
Expected Outcome: Project results are expected to contribute to some or all  of the following 
expected outcomes: 
• A community of EU civil security practitioners with common user/functional needs for 
innovative technology solutions is identified, supported by an industrial base, in 
particular SMEs and Startups, to access the public procurement market and scale up their 
business;
• Procurers facilitate the commercialisation of the innovative solutions developed by their 
successful suppliers by providing them with first customer references for the validation 
and first pilot deployment;  
• Tested and validated capacity of EU technology and industrial base to develop and 
produce technology prototypes that are accessible and meet the diverse needs of the EU 
user community, regardless of their gender, age and ability; 
• Improved delineation of the EU market (including demand and supply) for innovative 
civil security systems that can articulate alternative options for uptake in function of 
different industrialisation needs, commercialisation needs, acquisition needs, deployment 
needs and additional funding needs (beyond R&I funding).  
Scope: As past experience shows that pre -commercial procurement opens up the procurement 
market for startups and enables the public sector to address societal challenges more 
effectively, public procurers should make more strategic use of PCP. Applicants are invited to 
submit proposals for PCP action to acquire Research and Development (R&D) services and 
innovative civil security technology solutions. 
Proposals should demonstrate interest from a broader community of potential buyers, beyond 
the direct beneficiaries, who share similar needs and are open to jointly adopting the solutions 
developed, provided they are proven mature and operationally viable. The proposals are 
expected to include an analysis of the state of the art and market landscape, aligning research 
activities with identified needs and presenting a range of technical alternatives to address the 
challenge. Furthermore, to stimulate dialogue with the supply side, public procurers are 
required to organise proposals that should demonstrate sustainability of the action beyond the 
life of the project. 
The proposals should build on the outcomes of CSA projects funded under previous Horizon 
Europe work programmes aimed at creating Stronger grounds for pre -commercial 
procurement of innovative security technologies. The proposals should provide clear evidence 
to justify and de-risk the PCP action, demonstrating that the identified challenge is significant 
and necessitates a PCP action to mature certain technologies and compare alternatives. It 
should be shown that a consolidated group of practitioners and procurers with shared needs 
and requirements is committed to the PCP process, enabling informed decisions on future 
joint procurement of innovative solutions. Activities covered should include cooperation with 
policymakers to reinforce the national policy frameworks and mobilise substantial additional 
national budgets for PCP and innovation procurement in general beyond the scope of the 
project. The tender process to be followed is described in Annex H. 
Proposals should demonstrate commitment to exploiting project results beyond its conclusion, 
ensuring engagement with stakeholders and implementation of strategies for future uptake. 
Applicants should also clarify measures to ensure compliance with the principles of the EU 
Directive on public procurement, particularly those related to PCP. The required open market 
consultations should be completed in at least three EU Member States. Prior consultations 
conducted under previous CSA projects should be used, provided they ensured procurement 
viability and remain relevant to the current state of the art. 
Involvement of procurement decision makers is recommendable to ensure that end solution(s) 
are adopted by public buyers, increasing the societal impact of the related research activities. 
Therefore, procurers should declare in the proposal their interest to pursue deployment of 
solutions resulting from the PCP in case the PCP delivers successful solutions and indicate 
whether they will: 
• Procure successful solution(s) as part of the PCP. 
• Launch a separate follow-up procurement after the PCP to buy such type of solutions. 
• Adopt successful solutions without the need to procure them (e.g. in case of open -source 
solutions). 
• Foresee financial or regulatory incentives for others to adopt successful solutions (e.g. in 
case the final end-users of the solutions are not the procurers but for example citizens).  
In these four cases, the procurers can implement the project as a fast -track PCP178. In the first 
case, the procurers should foresee the budget in the proposal to purchase at least one solution 
during the PCP. In the second case, the procurers should include in the proposal a deliverable 
that prepares the follow-up procurement to purchase such type of solution(s) after the PCP. In 
the first and third case, the procurers should foresee sufficient time during the project to 
deploy and validate that the solutions function well after installation. In the fourth case, the 
procurers can use financial support to third parties to provide financial incentives to final end -
users that are not part of the consortium (e.g. citizens) to adopt the solutions, including costly 
hardware components, with a maximum budget of EUR 100.000. 
Applicants should propose an implementation of the project that includes: 
• A minimal preparation stage dedicated to finalising the tendering documents package for 
a PCP call for tenders based on the technical input, and to define clear verification and 
validation procedures, methods and tools for the evaluation of the prototypes to be 
developed throughout the PCP phases. 
• Moreover, to ensure the sustainability and uptake of the developed solutions, proposals 
should outline clear plans for post -PCP activities. As outlined in the general annexes of 
the Horizon Europe Work Programme 2026 -2027, the topic allows public buyers to use 
the fast-track PCP option (e.g. 2 instead of 3 phases) when they commit to buying or 
deploying the resulting solutions after the PCP. However, if such a commitment is not 
yet in place at the proposal stage, the call expects proposers to include a deliverable 
outlining concrete activities to prepare the ground for follow -up deployment or 
procurement after the PCP. 
 
• Launching the call for tenders for research and development services. The call for 
tenders should envisage a competitive development composed of different phases that 
would lead to at least 2 prototypes from 2 different providers to be validated in real 
operational environment at the end of the PCP cycle; 
• Conducting the competitive development of the prototypes following the PCP principles 
including a design phase, an integration and technical verification phase and a validation 
in real operational environment phase. In evaluating the proposals and the results of the 
PCP phases, the applicants should consider technical merit, feasibility and commercial 
potential of proposed research efforts. 
• Consolidating the results of the evaluation of the developed prototypes, extracting 
conclusions and recommendations from the validation process, and defining a strategy 
for a potential uptake of solutions inspired in the PCP outcomes, including a complete 
technical specification of the envisaged solutions and standardisation needs and/or 
proposals. This strategy should consider joint -cross border procurement schemes and 
exploit synergies with other EU and national non-research funds.  
Applicants are expected to maximise the visibility of the project outcomes to the wide 
community of potential EU public buyers. Liaison with other civil security communities 
beyond those addressed by the project is encouraged in order to assess the possible reuse and 
extensibility of the identified solutions to different domains. 
Finally, proposals are expected to address all applicable considerations expressed in the 
Introduction of the Strengthened Security Research and Innovation Destination.
