in China are not eligible to participate in the action. 
Subject to restrictions for the protection of European communication 
networks. 
The following additional eligibility criteria apply: 
This topic requires the active involvement, as beneficiaries, of at least 2 
authorities in charge of disaster risk or crisis communication 144 and 2 
representatives of local or regional authorities in charge of disaster 
response, from at least 3 different EU Member States or Associated 
Countries. For these participants, applicants must fill in the table 
“Information about security practitioners” in the application form with 
all the requested information, following the template provided in the 
 
submission IT tool. 
If projects use satellite -based earth observation, positioning, navigation 
and/or related timing data and services, beneficiaries must make use of 
Copernicus and/or Galileo/EGNOS (other data and services may 
additionally be used). 
Technology 
Readiness Level 
Activities are expected to achieve TRL 7 -8 by the end of the project – 
see General Annex B. 
Legal and 
financial set-up of 
the Grant 
Agreements 
The rules are described in General Annex G. The following exceptions 
apply: 
The granting authority may, up to 4 years after the end of the action, 
object to a transfer of ownership or to the exclusive licensing of results, 
as set out in the specific provision of Annex 5. 
Eligible costs will take the form of a lump sum as defined in the 
Decision of 7 July 2021 authorising the use of lump sum contributions 
under the Horizon Europe Programme – the Framework Programme for 
Research and Innovation (2021 -2027) – and in actions under the 
Research and Training Programme of the European Atomic Energy 
Community (2021-2025) 145. 
Security Sensitive 
Topics 
Some activities resulting from this topic may involve using classified 
background and/or producing of security sensitive results (EUCI and 
SEN). Please refer to the related provisions in section B Security — EU 
classified and sensitive information of the General Annexes. 
 
Expected Outcome: Project results are expected to contribute to some or all  of the following 
expected outcomes: 
• Development of decision support systems for disaster crises, utilizing near real -time data 
from the ground to enhance situational awareness and response; 
• Creation of systems designed to bolster civil preparedness, that enhance operational 
efficiency and response times, ensuring timely and effective management of various 
disaster scenarios including from early warning to early action 
• Integration of advanced data analysis and decision -making tools to support authorities 
and first responders in disaster situations.  
Scope: This topic focuses on enhancing existing decision support systems for disaster crises 
by integrating emerging technologies to improve civil preparedness and crisis management. 
 
The objective is to advance the capabilities of existing systems, making them more reliable, 
adaptable, and efficient through the incorporation of trustworthy AI technologies that ensure 
transparency, accountability, and ethical decision -making processes. Projects should aim to 
enable quicker and more informed responses during disaster scenarios. 
Proposals should focus on creating advanced systems designed to strengthen civil 
preparedness, helping authorities and responders manage various disaster situations in a 
timely and effective manner. These systems should leverage cutting -edge AI-driven tools to 
process large volumes of data, providing actionable insights that improve decision -making 
during critical moments, such as from early warning to early action. Emphasis should be 
placed on integrating advanced data analysis and predictive modelling to anticipate disaster 
developments and guide interventions, while ensuring that the systems are transparent, 
explainable, and built on principles of trustworthiness, inclusive and gender sensitive and 
ethical AI use and on secure AI deployments. 
Projects should conduct a stakeholder or market analysis and a roadmap or plan for uptake of 
the developed methodologies, findings, and technologies to the industry, the research and 
innovation community, and/or the relevant authorities. 
Additionally, test centres should play a key role in this research by increasing their capacity to 
trial and validate emerging technologies, supporting more effective civil preparedness and 
crisis response capabilities. 
The expected outcome is to create systems that not only enhance operational efficiency and 
response times but also foster better collaboration among stakeholders, including local 
authorities, emergency services, and other relevant actors. This includes integrating drones 
with state emergency vehicles, smart traffic systems, and law enforcement to enhance data 
driven disaster preparedness and emergency response, ensuring effective coordination and 
faster decision-making for local authorities. 
Projects should also contribute to improving the usability and accessibility of decision-support 
systems for diverse users, ensuring they are easily integrated into disaster management 
frameworks and can be used effectively in different crisis situations. The solutions should 
align with EU guidelines on AI ethics 146 and resilience-building, ensuring they complement 
existing civil protection and crisis management initiatives while driving innovation in disaster 
risk reduction. The Preparedness Union Strategy is a key document in this regard. Analysing 
the capacity gaps of the UCPM147 and finding synergies with projects from operational grants, 
such as the Knowledge for Action in Prevention & Preparedness (KAPP)148, is recommended. 
 
In this topic the integration of the gender dimension (sex and gender analysis) in research and 
innovation content should be addressed only if relevant in relation to the objectives of the 
research effort. 
Where applicable, proposals should leverage the data and services available through European 
Research Infrastructures federated under the European Open Science Cloud, Copernicus, 
Destination Earth as well as data from relevant Data Spaces. Particular efforts should be made 
to ensure that the data produced in the context of this topic is FAIR (Findable, Accessible, 
Interoperable and Re-usable).
