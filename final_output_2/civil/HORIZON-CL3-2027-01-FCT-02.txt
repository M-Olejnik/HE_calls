Specific conditions 
Expected EU

as set out in the specific provision of Annex 5. 
Eligible costs will take the form of a lump sum as defined in the 
Decision of 7 July 2021 authorising the use of lump sum contributions

Research and Innovation (2021 -2027) – and in actions under the 
Research and Training Programme of the European Atomic Energy 
Community (2021-2025) 50. 
Security Sensitive 
Topics 
Some activities resulting from this topic may involve using classified 
background and/or producing of security sensitive results (EUCI and 
SEN). Please refer to the related provisions in section B Security — EU 
classified and sensitive information of the General Annexes. 
 
Expected Outcome: Project results are expected to contribute to all of the following expected 
outcomes: 
• New tools, skills and methodologies for Police Authorities in Europe to deal efficiently 
with diverse communities as well as with diversity among police personnel are 
identified, developed and disseminated throughout Europe, leading to, among others, an 
increased trust to Police Authorities in general; 
• Modern and effective training curricula for Police Authorities in Europe are developed 
on community policing in diverse societies, including post -conflict zones, and 
addressing the needs of individuals from various social, ethnic and religious 
backgrounds, as well as marginalized groups such as migrants, LGBTIQ people, persons 
with disabilities, or returnees from war.   
Scope: This topic addresses challenges of community policing in increasingly diverse and 
sometimes also fragile societies, including the integration of returnees from conflict zones, 
migrants, as well as marginalized communities including LGBTIQ individuals and various 
ethnic and religious groups. 
Encompassing a post-conflict dimension too, particularly in the context of Ukraine, this topic 
aims to foster inclusive community policing practices that can adapt to the complexities of 
 
diverse societal dynamics. Proposals should explore innovative and inclusive approaches in 
police education, training and management that go beyond traditional models, resulting in an 
effective engagement with a diversifying society. Proposals should also seek to identify and 
develop effective practices and training programs that encourage a deeper understanding of 
diversity among police personnel and integrate a gender -sensitive and intersectional approach 
when relevant. In addition, proposals should assess how effective cooperation with Civil 
Society Organizations (or Non -Governmental Organisations) - representing various 
communities - can enhance reporting mechanisms, reduce hate crimes, and strengthen trust 
and cooperation between the police and the population. By improving police -citizen relations 
across diverse European contexts, the proposals should aim to contribute to enhanced security 
and social stability in Europe. Proposals’ findings should generate valuable insights 
applicable to varied policing environments, ultimately informing police forces across Europe 
about non -violent conflict resolution and constructive engagement strategies. Through 
collaborative research and training, proposals should equip Police Authorities with the tools, 
skills and methodologies necessary to effectively serve and engage with diverse communities, 
foster social cohesion, and build trust throughout Europe. 
Activities proposed within this topic should address the issue from various angles, combining 
social sciences with technological development and applications in a logical manner. 
Therefore, this topic requires the effective contribution of SSH disciplines and the 
involvement of SSH experts, institutions as well as the inclusion of relevant SSH expertise, in 
order to produce meaningful and significant effects enhancing the societal impact of the 
related research activities. 
Proposals should outline the plans to develop possible future uptake and upscaling at national 
and EU level for possible next steps once the project is finalised. Proposals should also 
consider, build on if appropriate and not duplicate previous research. Coordination among the 
successful proposals from this topic should be envisaged to avoid duplication and to exploit 
complementarities as well as opportunities for increased impact. Furthermore, if the proposals 
concern drug-related issues, they are expected to engage with the EU Drugs Agency during 
the lifetime of the project, including validating the outcomes. For aspects of training of Police 
Authorities, cooperation of successful proposals with CEPOL is expected, provided that the 
Agency opts out from applying for funding. To ensure the active involvement of and timely 
feedback from relevant security practitioners, proposals should plan a mid -term deliverable 
consisting in the assessment of the project’s mid -term outcomes, performed by the 
practitioners involved in the project. Finally, proposals are expected to address all applicable 
considerations expressed in the Introduction of the Fighting Crime and Terrorism Destination.
