innovations for civil security 
Call: Civil Security for Society 2026 
Specific conditions 
Expected EU 
contribution per 
project 
The Commission estimates that an EU contribution of around EUR 1.50 
million would allow these outcomes to be addressed appropriately. 
Nonetheless, this does not preclude submission and selection of a 
proposal requesting different amounts. 
Indicative budget The total indicative budget for the topic is EUR 3.00 million. 
Type of Action Research and Innovation Actions 
Eligibility 
conditions 
The conditions are described in General Annex B. The following 
exceptions apply: 
Subject to restrictions for the protection of European communication 
networks. 
The following additional eligibility criteria apply: 
This topic requires the active involvement, as beneficiaries, of at least 2 
relevant practitioners and 1 Research and Technology Organisation 
(RTO). For participants with practitioner status, applicants must fill in 
the table “Information about security practitioners” in the application 
form with all the requested information, following the template 
provided in the submission IT tool. 
 
If projects use satellite -based earth observation, positioning, navigation 
and/or related timing data and services, beneficiaries must make use of 
Copernicus and/or Galileo/EGNOS (other data and services may 
additionally be used). 
Technology 
Readiness Level 
Activities are expected to achieve TRL 4 -5 by the end of the project – 
see General Annex B. 
Legal and 
financial set-up of 
the Grant 
Agreements 
The rules are described in General Annex G. The following exceptions 
apply: 
The granting authority may, up to 4 years after the end of the action, 
object to a transfer of ownership or to the exclusive licensing of results, 
as set out in the specific provision of Annex 5. 
Eligible costs will take the form of a lump sum as defined in the 
Decision of 7 July 2021 authorising the use of lump sum contributions 
under the Horizon Europe Programme – the Framework Programme for 
Research and Innovation (2021 -2027) – and in actions under the 
Research and Training Programme of the European Atomic Energy 
Community (2021-2025) 159. 
Security Sensitive 
Topics 
Some activities resulting from this topic may involve using classified 
background and/or producing of security sensitive results (EUCI and 
SEN). Please refer to the related provisions in section B Security — EU 
classified and sensitive information of the General Annexes. 
 
Expected Outcome: Project results are expected to contribute to some or all  of the following 
expected outcomes: 
• Improved preparedness, evidence -based approaches and response capabilities, along 
with a strengthened ability to mitigate risks from diverse threats, by integrating validated 
disruptive technologies into real-world operations; 
• Accelerated adoption of innovative solutions by reducing barriers through rigorous 
testing and validation, fostering collaboration among public authorities, industry, and 
researchers to align technologies with real-world needs.   
Scope: This topic aims to support the integration of disruptive technological innovations 160 
into civil security by strengthening research and innovation activities that enhance 
preparedness, response capabilities, and risk mitigation. A key focus is bridging the gap 
 
between early-stage, low Technology Readiness Level (TRL) research and applied security 
solutions, ensuring that emerging technologies are effectively transitioned into operational 
use. 
Proposals should prioritize disruptive solutions that address diverse security threats while 
improving the efficiency and effectiveness of civil security operations. Emphasis should be 
placed on ensuring that these technologies are robust, reliable, scalable, and aligned with the 
needs of security practitioners. This includes fostering a structured pathway for transitioning 
low TRL innovations into practical applications, ensuring rigorous testing and validation 
processes for safety, performance, and interoperability. 
To achieve this, proposals should promote strong collaboration between researchers, public 
authorities, industry partners, and end -users. Such partnerships will help align technological 
advancements with real-world security needs, facilitating the co-development of solutions that 
are both innovative and operationally relevant. Ensuring that emerging technologies are 
ethically sound, transparent, and accessible will also be crucial to their successful adoption. 
The expected outcomes of this topic include improved preparedness through the adoption of 
cutting-edge technologies tailored to emerging security challenges, enhanced risk mitigation 
capabilities, and the accelerated integration of disruptive innovations into civil security 
frameworks. By fostering a collaborative ecosystem, projects should ensure that promising 
research transitions effectively into practical security applications, contributing to a more 
resilient and adaptive civil security landscape across Europe. 
To ensure that the proposed research and innovation activities are aligned to EU long -term 
strategic priorities, proposers are encouraged to consult relevant technology foresight 
exercises161. 
Finally, proposals are expected to address all applicable considerations expressed in the 
Introduction of the Strengthened Security Research and Innovation Destination.
